<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/23/tilera_cpu_upgrade/">Tilera gooses 64-core mesh processor</a></h3>
<p>Interesting to see a promising hardware platform (in this case, CPU and memory management) that do away with old, not always that efficient techniques and introduce smart changes. I hope to see more of these in (mainstream?) hardware soon</p>
<h3><a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080923-study-confirms-users-are-idiots.html">Fake popup study sadly confirms most users are idiots</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Follow-up questions revealed that the students seemed to find any dialog box a distraction from their assigned task; nearly half said that all they cared about was getting rid of these dialogs. The results suggest that a familiarity with Windows dialogs have bred a degree of contempt and that users simply don't care what the boxes say anymore.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thank you, Microsoft, for teaching users not to care by annoying them to dead...</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.newclearpower.eu/">NewClear Energy - Clear is the new Green</a></h3>
<p>As windmills, solarvoltaic cells and such aren't really that environment neutral (they take a *lot* of resources to create) and nuclear reactors aren't in the league of "Chernobyl" for ages anymore, I think this lobby club is quite interesting. For example, I think it would be interesting to see a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_bed_reactor">Pebble bed reactor</a> or the like here in the Netherlands. It's really safe and quite clean with a lot less waste than older techniques.</p>

<p>Tesla coils are awesome!</p>
