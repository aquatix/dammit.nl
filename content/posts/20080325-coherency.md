<p>*grin*, how coherent was <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=668">that</a>? :) I guess that intartubes thingee is melting my brain or something.</p>

<p>For those remotely interested in what I meant yesterday: I had been adding functionality to my weblog software [<a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/html/blog/">simplog</a>] a year or so ago to be able to save drafts and such, but didn't finish it at the time because of time constraints. However, that broke posting rants from the live version, so I had to use an older version of <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/html/blog/">simplog</a> to post, and then change a flag in the database by hand to have it show up on the weblog. Not the easiest way to do things ;)</p>

<p>However, I finally fixed those issues, so I can now post comfortably from the up-to-date version again. Always fix your backend when doing work on your project ;)</p>

<p>Time to fix some more projects...</p>
