<p>It's freezing outside, dark too, and it's about 2:30AM on my computer clock. I start to wonder what I'm doing here. I guess I should just get some rest and start counting some <a href="http://www.electricsheep.org/">electric sheep</a> [really, really neat fractal based screensaver; let it run a while, and you're hooked]. Hm, may explain why I'm still sitting here. Ah, and <a href="http://ubersoft.net/">Ubersoft</a> I guess.</p>
