<p>After the study dodging^Wevading [yeah, that's the word I should have chosen, but I was not in a mood to get my English completely correct ;)] of last Monday, there was the exam on Tuesday. Some disaster there. Ah well, at least I wasn't the only one, but it still sucks. I may have succeeded after studying the material for over a week, but that - erm - just isn't me =)</p>
<p>After some vocal ranting on the subject, I went to the VU today to study some maths for tomorrow, only to do a midterm for <acronym title="Operating Systems">OS</acronym> on impulse. Nice impulse: it was ridiculously simple [I didn't go to the classes and hadn't touched the sheets], so maybe it was a success. The maths's still boring tho'</p>
<p>But those sin's, cos's, integrals, power series and stuff are better settled in my head then the material of Tuesday. Still not quite my best skill though [that's a huge understatement].</p>
<p>OK, I'm off, trying to get those sinuses straight.</p>
