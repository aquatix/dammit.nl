<p>I find myself checking my e-mail after been to two parties while having made a kind of bet with a friend of mine to not use a pc for the weekend. Hmm, am I that addicted? I only wanted to send an e-mail and check up a small digicam I saw on one of the parties [mine is a bit too large to carry around everywhere I go; <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Casio/casio_qvr51.asp">this one</a> has 5MP too and is a lot smaller :)].</p>
