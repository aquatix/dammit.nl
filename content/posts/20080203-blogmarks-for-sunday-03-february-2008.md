<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=437640&amp;cid=22255362">Microsoft Launches IT Superhero Comic</a></h3>
<p>This comment about sums it up. Another notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't mean to sound cruel, but what is their target audience? Anyone who isn't in IT is going to think this is amazingly stupid. Most of those in IT will probably be using firefox and therefor not be using Silverlight. In the end its free press for Microsoft, I guess.</p></blockquote>

<p>And what about that "cross-platform" plugin SilverLight just to see some static images in the archive? What's an .exe file and how do I use it?</p>
<h3><a href="https://stpeter.im/?p=2128">Thinking Globally</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Yes, there are scare quotes around the last word in that sentence. Although the inaugural article in your climate series declared the scientific questions answered for good, I urge you to keep one eye on the work of real climatologists (not politicians and activists). After all, science is not a matter of counting noses, and scientific conclusions are never quite final, especially in so young a science as climatology.</p>
<p>We know the earth has been warming since 1860 or so, but why? Our little planet has been both much warmer in the past (forests in Greenland, cold-blooded dinosaurs in Wyoming and points north) and much colder (mile-high glaciers formed Long Island, the Thames River froze solid many winters in a row). Clearly, human industrial activity didnâ€™t cause previous warm periods, nor did a lack thereof cause previous cold periods. Something else must be going on.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you want to read more about the IE 8 version-targeting proposal, Matthew Pennell's roundup of over two dozen responses is a good place to start</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1041948/1_image_stabilizer_for_any_camera_lose_the_tripod/">$1 Image Stabilizer For Any Camera - Lose The Tripod</a></h3>
<p>Really neat, but losing the tripod is a bit far-fetched [the image stabiliser in my 17-85mm lense is really good, but also gets you only so far - 4+ seconds of exposure is not something you can do without a tripod :)]</p>
<h3><a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2008/01/28/introducing-prologue/">Prologue - A Twitter-like WordPress theme</a></h3>
<p>Useful for small teams; the privacy of a WordPress weblog, with the clearness of the Twitter UI</p>

<p>Where you'll have to take care that in <code>if (1 == $comment->user_id)</code>, 1 is actually the author's ID ;) Also, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/author-highlight/">this plugin does the same</a></p>

<p>About converting your data between the various platforms you use and the use of open standards, like mbox for storing e-mail. Thankfully, I'm using imap(s) for my mail, which is stored as mbox'es on my server, so I'm e-mail client agnostic. Mark has some good points, like Mail.app 2.0 on the Mac 'helpfully' converting his mbox-based archive to some proprietary emlx-based one, which should bite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software)">Spotlight</a> less. *sigh*</p>
<h3><a href="http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kimageshop/2006-March/004303.html">Open File Format for Raster/Bitmaps Graphics</a></h3>
<p>Soooo, the XCF format was deliberately undocumented by GIMP, a proprietary format despite being open source. Hmmm</p>
<h3><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks">When the bough breaks [dive into mark]</a></h3>
<p>Apple makes some nice stuff, but Mark Pilgrim has some good points on how not everything is as sunny as you might think. He <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/05/30/bye-apple">switched away from it</a> and <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/01/04/my-parents-desktop">converted some of his family</a>. He's now running Debian sid btw :)</p>

<blockquote><p>Using an iPod was “frustrating”. Seriously. OK, the first one was DOA, but my father returned it to the Apple Store without incident. But because he didn’t have a music collection, he relied on me to fill his iPod with new music every so often. The first time he went to recharge it, he plugged it into his Mac and iTunes “helpfully” wiped it and refilled it with the few songs that were in his iTunes library. Of course he didn’t realize what had actually happened until he went to the gym the next day and had virtually no music (and certainly no good exercise music). His next thought was that I should refill it, and then he would just copy the music from the iPod to his iTunes library. This led to a long discussion of why iTunes wouldn’t let you do that, and how this was technically different from me letting him borrow one of my CDs, and how if he really wanted to do that there were utilities but not from Apple, and so on and so forth. So yeah, my parents switched to Linux because — among other reasons — it was easier to use with their iPod. That’s how badly Apple has lost the plot.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/536004/?sc=swhr">Are Humans Evolving Faster, Becoming More Different?</a></h3>
<p>Really interesting article.</p>
<blockquote><p>Researchers discovered genetic evidence that human evolution is speeding up – and has not halted or proceeded at a constant rate, as had been thought – indicating that humans on different continents are becoming increasingly different.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow, those organisations really try everything to convince the world the US is prude/dump/fill-in-whatever. I really feel sorry for the normal Americans :/</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.aerojockey.com/software/ioccc/index.html">IOCCC Flight Simulator</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The IOCCC Flight Simulator was the winning entry in the 1998 International Obfuscated C Code Contest. It is a flight simulator in under 2 kilobytes of code, complete with relatively accurate 6-degree-of-freedom dynamics, loadable wireframe scenery, and a small instrument panel.</p></blockquote>

<p>Or, `Bavarian police intending to spy on Skype and ssl traffic'; on demand [during investigations] installing of the software on the subject's pc [should run windows with Internet Explorer or Firefox]. Look at the cost of installation and per-subject installation. Am I under suspicion now because I run Linux? :)</p>

<p>Hm, putting a sticker on my laptop would be a shame [it's neatly sticker-less], but a Debian one could be interesting...</p>
