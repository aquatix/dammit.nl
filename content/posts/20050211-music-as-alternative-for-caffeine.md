<p>While I'm working a bit more [define "bit"] at The Project, I'm listening to "Digitally Important: European Trance, Dance &amp; Techno" to stay awake. Music serves me very well, maybe even better than caffeine, as the uptempo rhythm gets me in a kind of flow that caffeine can't inflict.</p>
<p>Me tiiired. [Hm, up at 7:15AM, it's 2:35AM now]</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm off getting this sucker online.</p>
