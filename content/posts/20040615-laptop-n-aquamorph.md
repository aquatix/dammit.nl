<p>First: wow, that laptop is cool - well, hot atm, but whatever. It certainly is faster than any other workstation I own and it's finally more quiet than those vacuum cleaners I own :D</p>
<p>So, what have I been doing lately? Mostly worked some more. Visited a nice housewarming party [very nice house you have Harrie en Vanessa!] aka birthday party of those people. Then slept most of the Sunday that followed, rest of it spending with my laptop on my - well - lap installing some <acronym title="Open Source Software">OSS</acronym> on it. On winxp that is. D4 p41|\| ... Ah well, spend most of today preparing a new aquamorph cd, which I just burned with the build-in cd burner of this laptop. Booting it right now.</p>
<p>W00t it just started fine! So after a non functioning version I builded yesterday [for the insiders: something to do with a too new version of cloop] I finally have a new <a href="/?section=linux&amp;page=aquamorph">aquamorph</a> cd again. I'm going to stress test this thing and will likely release something usable in The Near Future(tm). [Mind that I have to spend this work studying for three exams. Ah well, <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a> is more fun :) ].</p>
<p>Off for some playing with aquamorph 0.1.03.1 [what is it with me and version numbers :P ]</p>
