<p>The last hacking session just ended and we're wrapping things up, packing stuff. I finally made aquamorph start Xfce4 properly [stupid permission thing on /tmp/.ICE-unix ...], so now I can start building a minimod modifying the user interface, making things a lot nicer for the user. Hopefully I can use a new basemod tomorrow already even. /me is getting hooked on committing already after contributing the Morphest 2005 grub bootsplash :)</p>

<p>Now only to get some sleep. Interesting talk going on still tho'</p>
