<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.eff.org/Net_culture/Folklore/Humor/borg_windows.skit">The Borg defeated by Microsoft</a></h3>
<p>Fun read!</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ODskdEPnQ">BumpTop 3D Desktop Prototype</a></h3>
<p>Really nifty, interesting and stuff, but I think it's utterly useless apart from the mode at the end, where you actually see the contents of the files. And what about the lack of filenames...?</p>
<h3><a href="http://mshiltonj.com/software_wars/current/">Software wars: Microsoft versus the World</a></h3>
<p>Interesting map</p>
<h3><a href="http://esl.about.com/library/weekly/aa110698.htm">Differences Between American and British English</a></h3>
<p>Just remember to be consistent with the flavour you choose</p>
