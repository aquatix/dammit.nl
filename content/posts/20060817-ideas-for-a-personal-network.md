<p>Some ideas for a modularised set of gadgets that work together in a <em>personal network</em> [e.g., "on the body"]:</p>
<ul>
<li>PDA [provides touch sensitive screen, other input possibilities, wifi, some storage]</li>
<li>Music player [provides hdd storage, has small screen and controls for standalone functioning]</li>
<li>Cellphone [provides gsm/3G uplink, possibly snapshot camera/video chat possibilities]</li>
<li>Wireless foldable keyboard</li>
<li>GPS/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_positioning_system">Galileo</a> mouse</li>
<li>Digital camera [can use GPS for recording coordinates in EXIF, bluetooth to store to hdd alongside its own card storage, pda can show pictures from hdd on its biggish screen]</li>
<li>Wristwatch with stats/phone &amp; music controls etc</li>
<li>[Bluetooth?] stereo headset with microphone</li>
</ul>
<p>Bluetooth 2 or low-power, quite highspeed equivalent connects it all. The PDA can control the music player and the cellphone [answer/make calls, send text messages etc].</p>
