<p>I got a shady proposal from the webmaster of a gambling site, suggesting a deal to increase pagerank for us both. I wonder how many people will actually agree to do this...</p>

Hi,

my name is Chris and I'm a freelance link developer, working mostly in the field of gambling.

I've noticed that your website links to gaming related sites and so would like to discuss with
you some link exchange possibilities between our sites.

I can provide you with links from well established sites that carry a wide variety of pagerank,
inbound links, and other SEO factors, in exchange for receiving links from your own
properties/sites.

If this may be of interest to you, please let me know and we can work out the details.

REGARDS,
Chris R. Bershad
