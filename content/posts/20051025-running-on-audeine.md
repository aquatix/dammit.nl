<p>I'm running on audeine [aural caffeine, aka good music -- yeah, I just made up that word] and sugar at this moment. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I figure it could be an autumn-dip. I haven't seen the sun in a good few days, safe for one moment of peek-a-boo, and it has been raining and being cold and windy for the same amount of time. Not considering studying for an exam and working my ass off. Oh well, at least I'm alive.</p>

<p>Gotta flex my body and put some projects online/back on track. I guess that'll motivate me :)</p>
