<p>This morning while driving to work I went from being snowed upon with sleeth to interestingly clouded skies (picture pink/purple/orange coloured feathered clouds in an almost sunny morning sky; a nice break from the gray). While nearing the city a work in, I noticed a dark gray mass at the horizon. It gave me the distinct impression of driving towards a mountain riff in the morning, which was amplified by the trees in front of it in my field of vision and the play of light. This resulted in the paradoxal feeling of going on a vacation while driving to work :)</p>
