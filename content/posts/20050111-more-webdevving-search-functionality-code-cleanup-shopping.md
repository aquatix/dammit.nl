<p>OK, I'm slacking I guess, but instead of studying I've added some search functionality to this weblog [see top of the bar on the right], and cleaned up a lot of code. Maybe I should opensource this little site; at least the code is readable now :) For a small ChangeLog <a href="index.php?page=plan">see the .plan page</a></p>

<p>About to go to town for looking for some nice electric stuff for our new home; we need a washing machine, microwave oven, refridgerator, cooking thing &amp; gear, a vacuum cleaner [which I think I get as present on my next birthday] and some other stuff. Maybe I'll buy a TV when I'm at it. Will be my first :D</p>

<p>I'm going to be sooo broke.</p>
