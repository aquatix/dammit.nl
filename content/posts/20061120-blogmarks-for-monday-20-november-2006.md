<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/17/uk_rfid_passports_cr.html">Boing Boing: UK RFID passports cracked</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>UK security experts have cracked the sooper sekure new UK biometric passports. It took 48 hours. With &pound;174 worth of sniffer hardware, attackers can read all the personal information off of any of the three million new UK passports in circulation -- and if combined with demonstrated hacks for reading RFIDs at a distance, this could happen from across the room, or even farther. You can then clone the RFID and stick it in another passport (surprise! your identity is now owned by a terrorist!).</p></blockquote>

<p>Our own Dutch biometric passport has been cracked for over a year already too. Gotta love the security our goverments ensure us!</p>
