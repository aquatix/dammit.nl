<p>I'm tweaking some stuff at this weblog, so please do a Ctrl+R, F5 or whatever it is your browser uses to refresh pages and other files [like the stylesheet this site uses]. Things will look better [at least, they will look like I intend them to].</p>

<p>Too bad the advice in the title can't be used in Real Life(tm)... Sometimes you would like to be able to press Ctrl+Z [or U for us vim users]</p>
