<p>Life goes on and things come and go. My girlfriend has been a professional pharmacist for 2+ months now, working full-time, while I am wrapping up the last courses of my computer sciences study, doing its projects in the meanwhile. <a href="http://www.alextreme.org/">Alex</a> in the meanwhile <a href="http://www.alextreme.org/drupal/?q=node/473">got his Master in AI</a>, while <a href="http://manuzhai.nl/">Manuzhai</a> on the other hand <a href="http://manuzhai.nl/weblog/comments/in-absence-of-great-thinking/">is falling in love</a> while working on his first Mac, gotten by his internship. A <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=274">sister-in-law</a> is getting her second offspring in a few months</p>

<p>On more technical and personal front, this weblog dammIT got an overhaul, making it look a lot better [at least, in my eyes ;)]. Also, the tools I'm using in my day-to-day internet life are changing: from using my <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/html/overload/">overload feedreader</a> daily, to using a <a href="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/">standalone reader</a> for a while [with less feeds] to discovering <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">the revamped Google reader</a> and moving there with only a feed or 22, which I can actually keep up with daily. I integrated its "Shared Items" feature in the link list at the right of the pages.</p>

<p>Me not using my own feedreader anymore doesn't mean its project is dead. The PHP codebase kinda is, but I still want to rewrite it in Python and making it a generic information manager, also taking care of your bookmarks, notes etc. However, I just installed <a href="http://sitebar.org/">Sitebar</a> on my server again [I used it for years some while back], and it's still great; even better now they use new techniques to make it all faster [XmlHttpRequest comes in handy there].</p>

<p>All-in-all interesting things to notice and acknowledge life goes on in an insane tempo. I'm only hoping to keep up :)</p>
