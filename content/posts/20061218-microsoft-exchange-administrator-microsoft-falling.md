<p>And I hear more voices saying the same thing. Will Vista be popular? Yes. It will be used by many people. Everyone will want "the latest and greatest" [forgetting that Apple has some really great software too], but at least a sub group will notice the absurdness and start looking for alternatives. With Linux' name gaining popularity, people will start noticing there actually *are* alternatives for the pest called windows with its spam, <acronym title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</acronym>, virusses and worms. Spam, because the spambot nets we see all over the net consist of windows machines. Millions upon millions of compromised machines sending out a multitude of that number in spam messages... Apple also has a name of <acronym title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</acronym>, but their machines are a lot safer. If you want security and ease of use on your current systems[s], you can download a random Linux distribution; <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> has made a name in that [try <a href="http://xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a> if you go that way]. Myself, I'll stick with <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> sid; also up-to-date, and easy to use due to its package management.</p>

<p>Will Vista be popular? I think it'll be about as popular as all windowses till now: widely used, widely cursed. Let's just hope enough people will see the right alternatives.</p>
