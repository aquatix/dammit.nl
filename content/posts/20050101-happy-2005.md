<p>A very good new year to you all! Even for those that have another calendar then I have, all the best for you.</p>
<p>It will be a very interesting year for us, because of our new house, lots of projects to do [I should make time for a <a href="http://www.morphix.org">Morphix</a> / <a href="/page/linux/aquamorph/">aquamorph</a> project again] and lots of other happenings. At least I'm glad I survived another year ;)</p>
