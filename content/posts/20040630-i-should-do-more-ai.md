<p>Just did the exam of Knowledge Representation Systems, an AI course. Haven't answered that much of bullshit in ages. Great fun :) It was about fuzziness, probability and stuff, so I answered in fuzzy sentences and thought back about The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy [Probability Drive anyone?]</p>
<p>This all sounded more fun [when reading between the lines of the slides] than all those mathematical courses I still have to do. Maybe I should switch studies? Or maybe I should try harder and continue with those Computer Science Master courses, which are way more fun than the Bachelor stuff [think Computer Graphics, Parallel Programming and stuff - more fun than Discrete Mathematics :)].</p>
