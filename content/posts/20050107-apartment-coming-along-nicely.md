<p>In other non-technical news, our new apartment is getting closer to a liveable state every day. The paint surely freshes things up big time, as will the whiting of the various ceilings and stuff next Saturday. Then, if the wallpaper replaces the current dull colours, and the vinyl we ordered today has been laid, we will have a terribly happy place to live in :P</p>

<p>I enjoyed a tv program today about the Real James Bond Gadgets(tm) with Roger Moore [making his typical sex-related jokes] and then one about the ongoing Dakar rally. Finally something enjoyable on that non-digital screen :)</p>

<p>Maybe I should spend this time working on a new <a href="/page/linux/aquamorph/">aquamorph</a>, but I had been working all day already ;)</p>
