<p>This is the subject of one of the spam messages I got today. Kinda links that software maker and incompetency rather nicely together, doesn't it? ;) As a sidenote, it's interesting the spammer used a normal mail program to send this crap, The Bat. [You see quite a wildly varying spectrum of mail agents when using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=thunderbird&amp;category=Message%20Reading&amp;numpg=10&amp;id=562">Display Mail User Agent Extension</a> in Mozilla Thunderbird].</p>

<p>On a completely different note: this weblog, dammIT, turned two years today. On this cold [yet not white...] winter day I look back on two years of putting my thoughts, frustrations and random ramblings online, beside my <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/">normal online manifestation</a> [hm, I notice I badly need to update <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~mbscholt/">my personal website at my university</a> :)]. I haven't been posting all that much lately, but I've been busy, and I think it's a good sign that I don't spend hours in my feed reader and posting links anymore. Am I finally getting a live? :)</p>
