<p>Here I find myself sitting behind my laptop working at a project with a deadline this evening [or tomorrow, but I'd like to have something finished by the time I go get some dinner], having my room slowly emptied [some things already disappeared some days ago, lots of things will vanish to our apartment in the next few days]. And I'm turning 23 today too.</p>
<p>I'd totally forgotten I'm having my birthday today until 11PM yesterday evening. Even now I'm not feeling remotely like celebrating, as I'm under quite some pressure to finish a project for University too. The other project feels like hacking on existing not-to-great .<acronym title="JavaServer Pages">jsp</acronym> files, which are going to be refactored in the not too far future, so that's a rather weird feeling. Ah well, it certainly tidies things up a lot and it pays some bills, so I shouldn't complain :)</p>
<p>Last but not least: I'm having a housewarming party at Saturday, February 12th. If you feel like visiting, please let me know!</p>
