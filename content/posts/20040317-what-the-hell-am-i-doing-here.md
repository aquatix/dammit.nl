<p>I've been busy today rewriting the [x]html of the aquariusoft.org site, making it xhtml1.1 on the fly and creating a stylesheet from scratch. I should be working on the <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ralf/cpp/">C++ course</a> assignment however. Well, guess what's more fun ;)</p>
<p>And then there's too much to read on the net. *blog overload*. I'm off. Bye.</p>
