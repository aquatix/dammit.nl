<p>This morning I was sitting in my car driving towards work. I had some nice music on the stereo and the sun was starting to warm the land. These are conditions in which I naturally start to hum along with the music, even singing along. This Wednesday was even better, with its sunny, warm weather; I caught myself humming contently while walking in the sun through and from university. Thinking of the new workstation I'll have in about two weeks time, I can't help but smile too.</p>

<p>Also, the memories of last Sunday's stroll through the woods in the dunes with my girlfriend make me hum happily. Sometimes life is just enjoyable :)</p>
