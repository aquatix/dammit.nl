[dammIT has a long history]({filename}moved-to-pelican.md) and only looks like this [for slightly over a year]({filename}dammit-alchemy.md).

Currently it is being generated by [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) which I like rather fine. A [recent question]({filename}question-about-statically-generated-websites.md) made me realise it involves quite some moving parts. However, when they are in place, using it is a dream. Well, a dream in my world at least :)

First, posts and other content are located in plain text files, versioned in Git.
