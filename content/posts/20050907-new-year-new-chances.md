<p>So I'm sitting here in a computer lab [windows...] at the Vrije Universiteit, enrolling on a new course: Advanced Topics in Software Design. Sounds kinda interesting, but it will be lots of work. Thank Light we're doing it in a group of three :)</p>

<p>Last night was the first time in some days I was at #morphix again, and it inspired me [in cooperation with the reinforced activity at the morphix-dev mailinglist] to pick up work on <a href="/page/linux/aquamorph/">aquamorph</a> again, and I want to try help the <a href="http://morphix.org/">Morphix</a> community by keeping .iso's up-to-date or some other work. I'm building a new [fast] server, with a not-too-fast pipe, so if somebody knows a task it can accomplish, let me know ;)</p>
