Did I mention that I'm going to a hackercon? Because I'm going. To a hacker conference.

It's going to be rad.

If you are also visiting [WHY2025](https://why2025.org/) in August this year, it might be interesting meeting up! Feel free to drop me a line or mention the village you're going to hang out.
