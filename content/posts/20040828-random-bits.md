<p>First I want to ask the readers of my humble blog [yeah, you two] if anyone uses the <a href="/~mbscholt/blog_comments.rdf">feed with comments included</a>. I'm asking, because noone gets a notification if someone posted a comment to a post or commented on a comment except for me. I know it's a tad broken because it ignores line feeds, but I'm planning to fix that Real Soon(tm).</p>

<p>On another note, I seem to be a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP). See <a href="http://www.manuzhai.nl/weblog/comments/self-test-explanation/">this piece from Manuzhai's blog</a>, <a href="http://www.manuzhai.nl/weblog/comments/self-test/">the test itself</a>, and <a href="http://www.hsperson.com/">this website about <acronym title="Highly Sensitive Person">HSP</acronym>s</a>. While reading the <acronym title="Highly Sensitive Person">HSP</acronym> site I could place some of my social properties and "skills" in a new light; I found myself very sensitive for details already years ago [got quite some remarks in the sense of "how the heck do you notice _that_?"]. I tend to be more assertive nowadays, but I used to be rather shy [I thought I was introvert, but changed my mind when I noticed that I wasn't the quiet person I used to be anymore], and I still am not that bold in new social environments. And there are more things I can identify with. Quite interesting to learn some other fundamental thing about myself.</p>

<p>A friend of my noticed the sudden increase of <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">Google mail</a> accounts in our group. I am to blame because I suddenly got 6 invites to give away to people. That's nice, but now having a <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">gmail.com</a> account isn't cool anymore :)</p>

<p>And as last point: I'm shamelessly [well, not quite] neglecting my duties to the <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a> community because of re-examinations, work, sleeping late, celebrating birthdays and wanting to work at some projects of myself, especially <a href="/?section=html&amp;page=aqute">aqute</a> <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>, which runs the <a href="/">aquariusoft.org</a> site. So, sorry people, but I'll be back soon. I just want to get the edit page functionality done, so I don't have to do any <acronym title="Database">DB</acronym> editing anymore to change a page. And adding nifty stuff like <acronym title="RDF Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds to news items is cool to do too. Well, I find it cool to thinker with at least; serves as vacation to me :)</p>
