Today I cloned the [dammit.nl repo](https://github.com/aquatix/dammit.nl) on my phone, as apparently I hadn't done that just yet. I had wanted to post a short blurp on December 31th saying goodbye to 2021, but I was fresh out of laptop.

I put it on my phone mostly to be able to quickly write quick thoughts or experiences from my pocket.

It reminded me of posts like [Stunned]({filename}20031223-stunned.md) - which I jotted back in 2003 using [Graffiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_(Palm_OS)) on my Palm ([Sony Cli√© S300](https://the-gadgeteer.com/2000/09/24/sony_clie_peg_s300_review/)) in the train back from watching Lord of The Rings, [I remember writing]({filename}i-remember-writing.md) from 2018, and [Planet Mobile]({filename}20140420-planet-mobile.md) that I wrote in 2014 which featured a bunch of my then-current gadgets.

Ah, memories.
