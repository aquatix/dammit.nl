<p>Just a short blurp to let you know I've finally come around to implement Apache rewrite rules for the <a href="/">aquariusoft.org site</a>. That means no more ugly urls with stupid parameters, but nice ones like <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/linux/aquamorph/">http://aquariusoft.org/page/linux/aquamorph/</a> for the aquamorph site. Please update your bookmarks accordingly [that means nicer webserver stats for me ;)] and notify people with the old url's on their site. [Yeah, I've to check for dead images now, I know]</p>
<p>BTW, if anybody knows how I can make these rewrite rules [put in an .htaccess file] work in a user account so I can use them for dammIT too, please let me know!</p>
