For years I've had Google Analytics and a self-hosted Piwik/Matomo instance to keep track of visitors. Fun fact: I barely ever looked at the stats. Other fun fact: my own presence did not even register, as my adblocker denied the requests to both. Yeah.

It wasn't a really hard decision then to disable the tracking codes on this weblog. I did not use them for vanity, I do not make money from this outlet (or any of my personal sites), and I certainly do not base my writing based on SEO. It is kind of interesting which pages get the most visitors though:

Anyway, happy un-tracked reading :)
