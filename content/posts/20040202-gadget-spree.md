<p>It's the time of the year again. I'm in love with several gadgets :) First, there is <a href="http://www.hauppauge.com/html/wintvpvr350_datasheet.htm">this TV card I'm going to buy anyway</a> [because it's a kind of birthday present]. And now there's <a href="http://reviews.designtechnica.com/firstlook26.html">a little cellphone</a> I've a crush on. Oh, and <a href="http://cacko.zaurususergroup.com/screenshots.php?menuid=2">there's a nice project</a> helping a <a href="http://www.bargainpda.com/default.asp?newsID=1592">little wonder</a> [wannahave :)] becoming even more cool. Keeps my life a little fun I suppose :)</p>
<p>I hope it's going to btw, because my study isn't quite helping... I've finally finished the Computer Networks project [submitted the sourcecode last Thursday and the documentation last Saturday, at my birthday of all days. Yeah, it was the deadline ;) ]. Now all hope is focused on the liking of the whole by the assistents. God, let them have merci ;) Then my focus was on assembling <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~mbscholt/schedule.php">my schedule</a> for the next weeks, which turned out to be quite, er, busy. Where did I hear that before... Ah well, keeps me busy.</p>
<p>When reading my daily batch of news and blogs, I came along some fine postings of my friend Alex, aka alextreme, from the project Morphix [among others]. <a href="http://am.xs4all.nl/drupal/?q=node/view/72">The first posting is about blogging</a> and why women are weird ;). <a href="http://am.xs4all.nl/drupal/?q=node/view/73">The second</a> is a piece about a subject I was thinking of myself. I like complaining [sorry sweet girlfriend], and I'm carrying this into more use bit by bit. Like the Footnotes section in my Computer Networks documentation [which complains about the sloppy support], I'm ventilating my founded griefs and complaints louder then first, when I was slowly boiling in them. Now I only hope people will actually listen to them and do something about it instead of thinking me a complete dork, which I'm surely not of course ;)</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't quite care whether or not this rantbox is read by anyone else then me or a lost websurfer [however I like to get some feedback of people who actually read it, so who is kidding who :)], but I find it relieving to write down my thoughts and some of my deeds here. And besides that it helps me getting my English straight :)</p>
<p>Well, running out of this king size edit field, so I suppose I've written enough for today. Hope you all enjoy your life a little more [mine isn't that bad either, but it has some nuicances :)]. Yours truly.</p>
