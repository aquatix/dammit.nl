<p>*Warcraft III flashback*. Well, I've finished my Databases I assignment for tomorrow^Wtoday. Furthermore, I'm busy adding whole lots of new functionality to this blog [nice enhancements to various navigation things], a soon-to-be-here(tm) RSS feed and such.</p>
<p>On a whole other note: it was a very nice day today. It was snowing. And then the sun was shining in a blue sky. And 3 minutes later it was snowing again and the sky was gray. I loved it :) It has snowed before this week, but now the sun had his share, and that was nice too.</p>
<p>And now I'm off to bed; too much IRC and homework making. Not good. But fun [at least the IRC part =) ].</p>
