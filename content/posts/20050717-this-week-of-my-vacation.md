<p>OK, so this is my so-called vacation. Lets see... Tomorrow I'll work, in the evening I'll [hopefully] enjoy <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407304/">The War of the Worlds</a>, on Tuesday I'm getting my hair done [badly needed ;)], am I going to do some administrational stuff and then we're going to visit my GFs grandparents. Wednesday will be a working day, as will be Thursday. Friday is free, except for some friends of the GF visiting. Busy, nice, but holidays? :)</p>
