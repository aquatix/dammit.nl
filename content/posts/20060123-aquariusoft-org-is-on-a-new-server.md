<p>OK, so everything went quite smoothly :) My new home server is serving up the files on *.aquariusoft.org now, and it feels fast! [Should be, as the little box does have quite a lot more horsepower than the previous one].</p>

<p>If you find something unusual, please contact me. The gallery is offline for a few days, as I don\'t want to pump over it\'s entire contents through two ADSL links, but rather wait a bit till I have the other box here too.</p>
