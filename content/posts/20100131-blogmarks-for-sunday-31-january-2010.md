<p>Good piece on the iPad being a device to bring closed computer systems to the masses. Will this mean the beginning of the end of open systems where you are the master of your hardware?</p>

<blockquote><p>What bothers me is that in terms of openness, the iPad is the same as the iPhone, but in terms of form factor, the iPad is essentially a general purpose computer. So it strikes me as a sort of Trojan horse that acculturates users to closed platforms as a viable alternative to open platforms, and not just when it comes to phones (which are closed pretty much across the board). The question we must ask ourselves as computer users is whether the tradeoff in freedom we make to enjoy Appleâ€™s superior user experience is worth it.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=801">Why GPSes suck, and what to do about it</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>I'm the lead of the <a href="http://gpsd.berlios.de/">GPSD project</a>, a service daemon that monitors GPS receivers on serial or USB ports and provides TPV (time-position-velocity) reports in a simple format on on a well-known Internet port. GPSD makes this job looks easy.  But it&#8217;s not &#8212; oh, it's decidedly not &#8212; and thereby hangs an entertaining tale of hacker ingenuity versus multiple layers of suck.</p></blockquote>
