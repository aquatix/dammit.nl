<p>Well, I'm totally pissed of by the e-mail I got a few days back from the supervisor of the Computer Networks assignment. We worked 2 times 5 months 3 days in the week on it, and all we got was a lousy e-mail stating something like "sorry, you didn't make the basic test. please try again next year". Sjeez.</p>
<p>With us are about 70 percent of everyone that worked on it this year, so maybe we could make a nice riot out of it.</p>
<p>Anyways, there's finally some good news for me too :) While studying last Wednesday for a reexamination, I found out the teacher made a mistake correcting the previous [flunked] exam. However, this man is only available on Fridays, so I did the new exam anyhow [not with much success thanks to a massive headache. Doing an examination from 18 to 21 hour is no fun...]. So I went to see him today and he was totally with me on this :) So instead of a 5.1 out of 10 I got a 5.9. And that's enough to pass it. W00t :)</p>
<p>Talked enough about that University part of my life. Tomorrow it's Valentines day and I'm not going to day anything about it. Gonna like the look on my girlfriends face ;) We'll see.</p>
