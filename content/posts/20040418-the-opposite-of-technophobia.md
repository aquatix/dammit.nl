<p>It's kinda sad: I just don't feel right when I don't have some electronic gadget with me. It doesn't matter where I'm going or what I bring with me - cellphone, pda, laptop, whatever - but I just have to bring some of my gadgets to feel at ease. Some example of addiction to electronics, or hardware in general.</p>
