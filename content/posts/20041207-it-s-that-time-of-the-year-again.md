<p>And again am I sitting here, hacking at some web projects, not studying for upcoming exams. <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/">dammIT</a> will undergo a fairly mayor facelift in the near future [when it's done and <acronym title="Internet Exploder">IE</acronym> plays nice :P ]. DJ Luna doing hardstyle on my headphones, for a change. If I want I can keep up the whole night, but it's not going to help me in any way other than just hacking more at <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> and <a href="http://www.applegeeks.com/">reading</a> <a href="http://www.megatokyo.com/">comics</a>. Maybe I should just catch some sleep now.</p>
<p>Classes tomorrow, then hacking at parallel programs. I just hope caffeine will do.</p>
