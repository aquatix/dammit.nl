<p>Ahh, it's that time of the year again. Spring. Birds whistling, sun shining, beer flowing, rain pouring now and then, nature acting odd, and people even weirder. It's the time of "the big spring cleaning", and people start off cleaning up [I really, badly need to clean up my server's and workstation's harddrives...], and go doing new things, starting new projects: Alextreme doing <a href="http://www.alextreme.org/drupal/?q=node/view/341">agents</a> and <a href="http://www.alextreme.org/drupal/?q=ajaxfun">Ajax</a> [<acronym title="also known as">aka</acronym> <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1111339822&amp;count=1">XML and script</a>]. And myself designing a fresh new logo for <a href="/~mbscholt/">dammIT</a> and building an online feedreader, based on <a href="http://magpierss.sf.net/">magpierss</a>, as I want my own <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>, but then without the crap. A project page will follow later. It's called "overload", as that's where it will lead me eventually: to an overload of information. But well, I like it that way.</p>

<p>And then there's the usual work and the projects for University, classes to follow and exams to do. Ah damn, two on the same time next week. Gotta run and sort that out now...</p>
