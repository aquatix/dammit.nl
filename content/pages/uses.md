What do I use?

## What Software Do I Use?

Quite a lot actually. Let's see...


### The Operating System

Linux, mostly the Ubuntu distribution. Yes, that sounds very boring, and that's mostly because it is, but It Just Works(tm) and I like tinkering with my own software better these days.


### Editors

- [vim]({tag}vim)
- JetBrains PyCharm
- Obsidian for notetaking and building out my [second brain]({tag}secondbrain)

### The Browser

Firefox.


### Other Software

A lot of terminal use.

- syncthing
- git
- paperless
- navidrome
- plex


### Mobile

Android phone, Pixel.

- Obsidian
- Termux
- FairEmail for email
- FluffyChat for Matrix chat
- weechat-android for IRC, makes connection to weechat on one of my servers
- TickTick for todo
- PlexAmp and Symfonium for music through Plex and Navidrom respectively
- Poweramp for music stored locally on my phone (works great with high-quality audio dongles like those from Hidisz)


## And what Hardware?

Desktop

Laptops


## What would be your dream setup?

Linux-based mobile computing.
