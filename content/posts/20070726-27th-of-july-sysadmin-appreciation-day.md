<p>Check <a href="http://sysadminday.com/">the  System Administrator Appreciation Day site</a>, and go to the nearest server room/basement/closet-with-pale-guy-at-a-noisy-computer and show them you appreciate it they don't ruin your day by disconnecting everyone from the network except them and their buddies to play their favourite game without lag. Well, at least they didn't do so yesterday. Oh hell, just give them a hug :)</p>

<p>[Disclaimer: If you're sure they wouldn't appreciate a hug, then don't, as you may just not have an account/contract/digital life anymore within the next 24 hours. Just saying.]</p>
