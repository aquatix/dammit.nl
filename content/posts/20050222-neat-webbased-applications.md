<p>Anybody knows <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">webmail</a> applications, but there exist a whole lot of webbased applications that you can run on your own server/desktop-with-webserver. Of course a whole bunch of <acronym title="Content Management Systems">CMS</acronym>'s, <a href="http://www.punbb.org/">Forums</a>, <a href="/~mbscholt/">weblogs</a> etc, but I want to highlight some more exotic ones.</p>

<p>First, I use <a href="http://www.sitebar.org/">Sitebar</a> since July last year. Sitebar is an online bookmarking tool, which can sit in a sidebar of your favourite browser, or just in a tab of it or whatever. Anyway, you can integrate it in your browser if you want, import your existing bookmarks of all those great pr0n^Wgadget sites and have access to your bookmarks wherever you have access to your webserver. It's written in <a href="http://www.php.org">PHP</a> and is a real gem if you like collecting links and actually find them back.</p>

<p>Secondly, there's <a href="http://zoe.nu/">Zo&euml;</a>. I discovered this gem only recently [read: today], but it's already digging my e-mail archives. So what is it? It's "google for your e-mail". It indexes your e-mail folders and presents a nice web frontend, which you can query in lots of ways. Find all e-mail of your birthday last year, all mail from your lover or your work. Whatever. It works just like <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>. It's written in Java, and can reside on your desktop or your server. It can act as server itself [indexing your sent and received mail immediately], as client [POP3, IMAP], or just can import your mboxes. Very, very neat.</p>

<p>Lastly, I can recommend <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/">AWStats</a>. If you have a webserver and like statistics, this program is made for you. It's a nice piece of Perl script which digs your <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> logs [or even your ftp or e-mail logs] and presents it in a nice way, including graphs, reverse lookups of domains, what browsers people used and what search keys people found your site with [very, very interesting, as people are really weird considering how they find my websites :)].</p>

<p>Just a note that I'm not affiliated by any of these projects. I just like them so much that I wanted to highlight them, and maybe create a Better World(tm) for somebody out there.</p>
