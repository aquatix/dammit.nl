> The easiest way to see how much you need a blog is to do this thought exercise. Imagine going back in time to a 21-year-old in 1952 and asking them what their opinions are, and where you could find a book of those opinions. Here’s what they would say.

> (looking behind them before turning back) Um, are you talking to me? I don’t … why … why would anyone care what I have to say?

> Many of you are thinking that right now, in 2022. Why would anyone want to know what you have to say? That right there is why you need a blog. It’s not the 1950’s anymore. You are not your resume. You are a human with preferences, interests, and opinions. And many of those will resonate with others in ways you can’t imagine before you put them out there.

You have more to say than you think. Even things you might find trivial like 'I just fixed this simpel issue I had this and this way' might help people. My more popular blogposts still are the various howto's.

Also, for some reason, it can be very satisfying to have a little corner of your own, even though (it seems) you're only talking to yourself. It helps me focussing my thoughts, fleshing out ideas and the act of having finished an article or even an about page is very rewarding.
