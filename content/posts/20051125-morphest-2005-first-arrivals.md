<p>Alextreme and Gandalfar [Jure] have arrived a few hours ago after a really exciting *cough* trip, with Jure almost traveling half a day by plain [or rather: sitting around at the airport]. They've brought they're laptops and Alex his workstation/server and some miles of UTP cable. Too bad the new 5 port switch is already fully occupied :)</p>

<p>This is going to be one fun long weekend I think :)</p>
