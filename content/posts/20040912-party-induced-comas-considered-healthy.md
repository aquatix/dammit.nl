<p>Finished my breakfast at about 3PM today after about 12 hours of sleep. That twelve hours compensated for the about 2.5 hours of sleep I got the night before, at Alex' place, after a night of drinking beer, wandering around looking for a train [missing the last one home], wandering over to a pub, having a good time again, going back to Alex' place to watch <em>I, robot</em> while being barely awake and falling asleep at the couch. Coffee really helped with getting me started again [read: not yet awake then]. I wasn't quite awake while getting to work by train, metro and foot too, and only after three Red Bulls, the Prodigy and lunch I was starting to actually getting some work done again. Ah well, it wasn't a bad day. A quite fun one even, making fun with coworkers.</p>

<p>I didn't need one of these <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/2994557356722101/">nifty GPS belts</a> to get to a metro station and later to find a train back home and then my bed, which was a good sign. And with the new Prodigy [Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned] I'm actually enjoying this Sunday. Especially Hotride is one hell of a track. So, while <a href="http://www.alextreme.org/drupal/?q=borkwayparty">Alex continues looking for his vacuumcleaner</a>, I went chuckling over an <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/6281976987676276/">iVan advertisement</a> [one of a zillion iPod ad spoofs], about a guy loosing his last piece of property in the fierce winds. Talking about going fast: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7277417973117163/">with these haunting your car</a> you would want to drive fast. Of course they're only balloons, but of the better kind.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I ran across a <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> script for <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/3633953427552507/">GMail for cellphone</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/8154940051659251/">scary electronics for inside your body</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/4586149837293461/">freaky cars</a> with names of a favourite PDA phone, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/2487373304194605/">an example of bad interface design</a> in a Samsung cellphone, a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1141583269424672/">new Samsung linux based PDA/cellphone</a>, which is the sister of the Samsung SPH-i700 we're playing around with at work, but both probably won't release in Europe... Not that I care about the pocketpc version, but the linux based one looks cool. So does <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/5440236356956557/">this designer PC</a> which sports a decent, clean design, as Apple is specialised in. Too bad it runs windows, but I guess GNU/Linux will run smoothly on it too ;) At least <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/4618484394872473/">this nifty tablet does</a>. Finally a decent GNU/Linux based tablet!</p>

<p>In my party-induced coma I had some dream about an <a href="http://www.2r2s.de/irdt_concept.html">inflatable space ship</a>, which turned out to be a real design. At Alex' party we all agreed that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/2746532543231732/">tech support sucks</a> [it may be good for your skill in judging people, so you can adjust your speech to their level of noobness]. I see more and more worrying signs of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1498517852773717/">common sense being replaced by technology</a> [think about the new security systems of the <acronym title="United States">US</acronym> too], so I was a bit relieved when I got to laugh about <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/4070977119820633/">this little cartoon</a> making fun out of the new iMac.</p>

<p>So, do I have anything useful to say today? I guess not, it's my blog/rantbox after all. However, I would like to mention that Alex' party was fun, that he has some big ass appartment [he even has a huge bath, damn him], that <em>I, robot</em> actually is quite good, that it's a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/6313210432142854/">freaky</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/5451346356845546/">weird world</a> we live in, that I'm going to hack at my <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html">Minix</a> TCP stack this week for the third year, that <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/books/ds1/">Distributed Systems</a> is quite <a href="http://www.globule.org/contest/">fun</a>, that drinking beer at the <acronym title="Vrije Universiteit">VU</acronym> is even more fun [scheduled tomorrow], that weekly comas are good and that I suck at writing rants. Especially while being asleep and facing another week of hard labour. Ah well, at least it's fun sometimes.</p>
