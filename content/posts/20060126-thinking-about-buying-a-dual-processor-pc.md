<p>Puff-n-Stuff aka SithAdmin in #morphix at freenode.net told me he had a dual athlon mp2000+ motherboard with dualhead matrox g550 video card, power supply and 4GiB ram for a nice price. I was interested from the point he named the price and the shipping fee :) Also, instead of the matrox, I could get an nvidia 440 from him, so it'll be quite a nice upgrade for my trusty ol' AMD Duron 750Mhz work horse. And a nice birthday present for myself :)</p>
