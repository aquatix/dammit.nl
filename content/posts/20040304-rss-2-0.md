<p>I've reworked the RSS feed code, so it does validate now. It was RSS 1.0 [kinda], and now it is valid RSS 2.0. Weeeh :)</p>
<p>If only <a href="http://www.feedreader.com/">Feedreader</a> was able to understand the &lt;content&gt; tags, I would be able to read my own blog at work =) Thankfully, <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/straw/">Straw</a> works flawlessly.</p>
