<p>I did the <a href="http://www.thudfactor.com/geekquiz.php">Geektest</a>, which tests what level of geekiness you posess. From totally non-geek, to geek, to nerd. So geek is actually a better thing then nerd :)</p>

<p>I got a score of 42%:</p>

You can hang out with normal people or you can hang out with geeks which means you often have geeks as friends and/or have a job where you have to mediate between geeks and normal people. This is an important role and one of which you should be proud. In fact, you can make a good deal of money as a translator.<br />
<br />
<b>Normal:</b> Tell our geek we need him to work this weekend.<br />
<b>You [to Geek]:</b> We need more than that, Scotty. You'll have to stay until you can squeeze more outta them engines!<br />
<b>Geek [to You]:</b> I'm givin' her all she's got, Captain, but we need more dilithium crystals!<br />
<b>You [to Normal]:</b> He wants to know if he gets overtime.<br />
