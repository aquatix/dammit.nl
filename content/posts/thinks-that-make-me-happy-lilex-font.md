A few weeks ago I ran across the [Lilex monospace font](https://lilex.myrt.co/), which is derived from the already excellent [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex), but with some extra fancy stuff like [ligatures]() (which I don't really use, but sure are pretty) and other tweaks to make it look even better.
