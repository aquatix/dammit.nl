<p>Went to <a href="http://www.tine.nl/">TINE</a> yesterday. It was a little bit boring, except for some of the smaller stands and the [somewhat forced] discussion about Open Source and Linux in commercial use and with the government. We came along the stand of <a href="http://www.amaze.nl/">Amaze</a>, a small company building a <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. Maybe a nice company to do my work placement in the last year of my study.</p>
<p>We raced a little in an old Sega arcade Formula 1 simulator and went home with to much paper. And a very cheap pocket calculator. Ah well :)</p>
<p>Today I went to classes. Very boring [stupid databases :)], but at least I learned some things. Then went home and sat in the sun for a while. Now I'm just browsing around, as usual.</p>
<p>On a sidenote [just funny]: a guy on Planet Debian writes about some funny <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/terryfish/30965.html">misheard lyrics</a>. And <a href="http://www.manuzhai.nl/">Manuzhai</a>'s site seems to be up again =)</p>
