<h3><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7911645.stm">'Oldest English words' identified</a></h3>
<p>Some interesting research done on the tree of words (ancestors and such)</p>

<blockquote><p>Across the Indo-European languages - which include most of the languages spoken from Europe to the Asian subcontinent - the vocal sound made to express a given concept can be similar.</p>

<p>New words for a concept can arise in a given language, utilising different sounds, in turn giving a clue to a word's relative age in the language.</p>

<p>At the root of the Reading University effort is a lexicon of 200 words that is not specific to culture or technology, and is therefore likely to represent concepts that have not changed across nations or millennia.</p>

<p>"We have lists of words that linguists have produced for us that tell us if two words in related languages actually derive from a common ancestral word," said Professor Pagel.</p>

<p>"We have descriptions of the ways we think words change and their ability to change into other words, and those descriptions can be turned into a mathematical language," he added.</p></blockquote>
