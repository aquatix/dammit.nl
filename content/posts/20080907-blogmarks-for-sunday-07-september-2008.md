<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.crosscut.com/politics-government/17341">About Sarah Palin: an e-mail from Wasilla</a></h3>
<p>A story about McCain's vice president nominee from someone who knows her personally. Her track record of governing doesn't sound all that sunny. (Her pro-life, anti homo-rights aren't speaking for her too, IMHO).</p>
<h3><a href="http://ifyouseesomething.net/2008/09/03/google-releases-new-chrome-browser/">If Google were...</a></h3>
<p>Good times</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.nrcnext.nl/projecten/covers/article1970170.ece/Astrologie_is_onzin._En_ja,_dat_is_erg">[Dutch] Astrologie is onzin. En ja, dat is erg</a></h3>
<p>I'm a bit ambivalent to astrology done by serious people, but there's a lot of rubbish [like those generic horoscopes, always good for a laugh]. As a scientist I have to agree with the issues this astrophysicist raises</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.nu.nl/news/1729126/1203/Palin_voor_President.html">[Dutch] Palin voor President</a></h3>
<p>It's a column, it's unsubtle, but he has some good points. Especially the black/white thinking [exclusive-or] of the US politics is oversimplified. It's a brilliant move from McCain to choose her as running mate though. A lot of people will identify with her. Oh well, we'll see</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/09/02/anthropomorphic-cudd.html">Anthropomorphic cuddly lights: LightMate</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Can electric energy fill the void of human absence? LightMates are soft anthropomorphic pillows and warming lamps.</p></blockquote>

<p>Heh, funny</p>
<h3><a href="http://tabletblog.com/2008/08/nokia-announces-ntropic-nseries.html">Nokia announces Ntropic Nseries phone/tablet harmony (as if)</a></h3>
<p>Now if this could become reality. We really need some better synching functionality for mobile devices...</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.tmk.com/ftp/humor/computer-error-messages.txt">Funny computer error messages (from the unix world)</a></h3>
<p>Great stuff from real OS'es and computers :)</p>
