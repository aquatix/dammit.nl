<p>No, I'm not dead. I'm just quite busy with some projects, my work and that evil thing called Real Life ;) Also, I decided to try to post some more meaningfull blog entries like I used to do [meaning of life, why public traffic sucks and about technomancers - preparing a post on the last one].</p>
<p>But as it stands, I'm quite occupied with Real Life and getting a new <a href="/?section=linux&amp;page=aquamorph">aquamorph</a> release out of the door. It's starting to look quite nice, so when this weekend is over, there'll most probably be something new to be downloaded!</p>
<p>Screenshots will follow when I've tweaked some stuff.</p>
