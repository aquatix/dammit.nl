<p>I updated the comments design today. It looks a lot cleaner now, shows linebreaks as actual breaks and the system sends me an email when someone adds a comment. Neat :) A lot of internal code cleanup makes it actually a nice package I could release. I'm wondering if I want that, and what license I should use if I decide to throw it in the wild.</p>
<p>On real life front: my <acronym title="The ICT &amp; Networking Event">TINE</acronym> 2004 ticket has arrived. It's a badge that lets me enter the event for free. I'm planning to go to the "Linux and Open Source" day [the 21th of April] with <a href="http://www.manuzhai.nl/">Manuzhai</a> and <a href="http://alextreme.org/">Alextreme</a>, but maybe I'll visit the other subjects on the 20th and 22th too, because "Security" and "Innovating with ICT" sounds interesting too.</p>
