<p>It has just started, but the first evening with the whole crew is awesome. We are eating pancakes <a href="http://alextreme.org/">Alex</a> is baking [he's a lot slower cooking than we with us ten can eat :P], and discussing stuff, hacking kernels, trying to get livecd's to work at laptops [why do laptops have to be such a pain the ass?]. Interesting stuff.</p>

<p>We're planning on taking Amsterdam tonight in our quest of dominating Europe [well, don't we already?], which will be a party that'll last until the wee hours of Sunday morning, after which we will get one of the first trains back or something. And that with quite a lot of people already sleep deprived :)</p>

<p>So, things are fun. I'm trying not to think about the electricity bill tho' ;)</p>
