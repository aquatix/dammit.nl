Today it's [12 years ago I officially started this weblog](http://dammit.nl/p/5) and I finally have taken some steps to get the [next generation of the codebase](https://github.com/aquatix/kontent) working on my server. It's getting there, looking forward to continue dammIT in its Django incarnation :)

This year has been fascinating; junior went from barely walking to running around, thrashing the place while ranting about the wind blowing a bit too hard outside. In the meanwhile, junior number two is about to be here too, so I'm sure next year we are going to have a really interesting, sleepless time.

Looking forward to all the weird, frustrating, wonderful, funny things waiting for us!
