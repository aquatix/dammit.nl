<h3><a href="http://thefedoralounge.com/">The Fedora Lounge</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>This swanky venue resembles a 1930s-40s club comprised of like-minded people who share an interest and passion in the "Golden Era." So, stop on in, pull up a chair, order a drink and discuss the finer things in life, from cars to hats and clothes, music, aircraft, WWII, movies, and more.</p></blockquote>

<p>Classy.</p>
