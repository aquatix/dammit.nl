<p>Currently testing a new version of my <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/linux/aquamorph/">aquamorph</a> livecd, which is close to being done. In my last post of yesterday I forgot to tell I had been working on it that day too, so it wasn't a completely wasted Thursday ;)</p>

<p>Besides the idea bmsleight has for our Open Source Company [OSC :)] -- which I will keep secret for the time being -- I thought about having the company rolling out Linux based networks and doing some system/network management. Would be interesting, and generates money I guess, which we can use to finance not-yet-revenue-generating fun projects. If managing weird heterogeneous networks doesn't absorb all our time, that is.</p>

<p>On a more personal level, I want to take <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/html/overload/">overload</a> to a new level: besides being the slurp-my-news thing, I want it to become the place for storing my bookmarks, notes and other information too. Put in a uniform way of tagging these items, and you have a central place where you can go for your information; you can add the page of a news item as bookmark, make a note which you attach to it, let it share a tag about a project it's relevant to, click the "add to my public snippets" button for sharing it with the world, etc. I imagine it having a Google News-like frontpage too. I want to start on this shortly, but will do so on another location than <a href="https://overload.aquariusoft.org/">the live version of overload</a>, so people can continue using the reader without fear of breakage.</p>

<p>Of course, besides adding all this new functionality, I want to finish the basic stuff that's not-yet-there in the current version too. [What's up with the not working importing/exporting of OPML files for example?].</p>
