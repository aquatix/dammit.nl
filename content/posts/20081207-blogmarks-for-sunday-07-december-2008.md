<blockquote><p><a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/home/2008/12/nokia-n97-marks-evolutionary-milestone-for-nseries-and-mobilekind.html">Today's N97 launch</a> reminded me of a big mental difference between using Nokia or Apple phones: with Apple, you're merely a consumer, where Nokia's devices allow you to participate in the information flow, to be a producer. Back in 1932, <a href="http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html">Bertrand Russel wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The pleasures of urban populations have become mainly passive: seeing cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the radio, and so on. This results from the fact that their active energies are fully taken up with work; if they had more leisure, they would again enjoy pleasures in which they took an active part.</p></blockquote>

<p>The whole <a href="http://www.nseries.com/index.html">N series of devices</a> seems dedicated for allowing you to take that active part: decent cameras, video recording capability, reasonably good keyboards. <a href="http://www.macseven.com/files/20070610_dvorak_warns_the_iphone_keyboard_sucks.html">Not so</a> with the iPhone.</p>
