<p>I'm in a Rammstein mood at the moment. Freaking weather [had to ride my bike through an almost freezing, but in any way very wet storm...], and that freaking University. To many courses to follow, however it should be doable. It's just that I'm feeling overwhelmed. So I felt like screaming [Rammstein helps :)], surely after that darn exam Tuesday evening. I hope it's going to be enough to get me through, but I fear dark fears :/</p>
<p>Ah well, time to get some PHP practise at one of my websites. Maybe I should finish that Schedule parser I started earlier this day, or finally finish my nice bookmarks script. Or add edit functionality to this blog [nah, who needs to edit his own rants :)], or to the <a href="/">aquariusoft.org</a> site. Then I'm going to take a hot shower and watch some taped <acronym title="Crime Scene Investigation">CSI</acronym>: Miami. Great series, btw.</p>
<p>I'm calming down already, should do this more often :)</p>
