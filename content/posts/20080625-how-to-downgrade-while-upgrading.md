<p>Yesterday evening I flashed <a href="http://maemo.org/news/announcements/view/os2008_feature_upgrade-reflash_your_tablet-for_the_last_time.html">Diablo (Maemo 4.1)</a> on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N810">Nokia N810 tablet</a>. This is a great update BTW. I restored the backup of my contacts and some other minor things and set up the Modest email client (which suprisingly now marks my mails as 'read' on the imap server, which it didn't before). However, almost every other program still has to be packaged for this operating system update, so now I'm stuck with a nice tablet that I can only surf and read my mail with :)</p>

<p>/me wants ssh for his daily IRC dose on the couch, dammit ;)</p>
