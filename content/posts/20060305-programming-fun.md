<p>Finally learning to write decent C with Posix threads, processes, pipes, inter-process communication etc. And some Java with threads too. Quite interesting I have to say, but that may be the influence of the large glass of whisky I consumed this evening; I really love late night hacking/irc'ing/music listening/booze consuming ;)</p>

<p>*Idly wondering what projects our Open Company would create*</p>
