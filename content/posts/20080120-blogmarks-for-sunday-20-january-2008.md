<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_syndrome">Student syndrome</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>[...] the phenomenon that many people will start to fully apply themselves to a task just in the wake of a deadline. This leads to wasting any buffers built into individual task duration estimates.</p>

<p>The student syndrome is a form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination" title="Procrastination">procrastination</a>, but with more of a plan with good intention. For example, if a student or group of students goes to a professor and asks for an extension to a deadline they will usually defend their request by noting how much better their project will be given more time to work on it; they request this with all the right intentions. In reality most students will have other tasks or events place a demand on the time they fully intended to commit to improving their paper or project. In the end they will often end up close to the same situation they started with wishing they had more time as the new delayed deadline approaches.</p></blockquote>

<p>Riiight, wigs for cats...</p>
<h3><a href="http://sancairodicopenhagen.com/joe/KDE5">KDE 5.0 Available</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>A new panel has been developed which features buttons, clickable elements, tactile areas, hotspots, user-responsive icons, and buttons all which completely revolutionize the way clicking around to find applications is done. It's a totally new paradigm, and we have the youtube videos with the enthusiastic narrative to establish reasonable claim to the re-invention of the clickable button.</p>

<p>The KDE artwork team has spent literally hours on enhancing the visual appeal of KDE 5; new and exciting shades of blue have been blended ever more seductively into slightly different shades of blue which the artwork team insists has a different name and completely different visual impact.</p>
