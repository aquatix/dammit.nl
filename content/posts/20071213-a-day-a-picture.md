<p>Today I started an experiment, encouraged by <a href="http://basvandijk.eu/">Bas</a>, to shoot a picture of some random subject a day, and post it on a weblog. I started by creating a <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/v/photographs/pic-a-day/">gallery album for it</a>, and I'll try to set up some kind of photolog in the near future [being it a Wordpress weblog, or an addition to this self-written weblog software]. Here is the first one in hopefully a long series:</p>

<div class="content-image"><div><a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/v/photographs/pic-a-day/ice_on_the_roof.jpg.html"><img src="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/images/content/ice_on_the_roof.jpg" alt="Ice on the roof" title="Ice on the roof" /></a></div></div>
