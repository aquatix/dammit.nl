The year 2022 has been an interesting one for me personally. At work, we had a lot of interesting developments, most of which I'm pretty happy with. On a personal level, we had some breakthroughs with matters we have been struggling with for quite some years now. I think I'll keep the details for a 'hindsight is 20-22' post and stick with wishing all of you a very good 2023!

Stay healthy, stay sane!
