I finished watching [Mr. Robot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/) yesterday and it was amazing.

If you like to watch an intriguing TV series, with good use of technology for once (ohai Hollywood, yes you suck at portraying real tech) and an unusual protagonist, treat yourself to the four seasons (45 episodes) of this mighty fine adventure.

Stop reading the internet and start watching!

(No really, stop reading, too many spoilers at the moment and it is so much better when you discover everything yourself).
