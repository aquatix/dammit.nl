<p>Fear not, this is still the dammIT you know, except that it looks a bit... new. I felt bored a bit and next thing I knew I had restyled it all ;) Kudos go to <a href="http://basvandijk.eu/">Bas</a> for providing really useful feedback on colours, layouts and such and even designing the new dammIT logo (the text part). The picture is all mine, shot today at the park next to our home.</p>

<p>If you're missing the links that used to be in the bar to the right, check <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?page=kudos">the Kudos page</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you like it! Feedback is welcome :)</p>
