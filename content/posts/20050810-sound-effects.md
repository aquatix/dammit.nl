<p>I was getting bored getting a Red Alert every time somebody spoke my name at IRC [the sound is bundled with <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">GAIM</a> messenger], so I went looking for free sound effects. First, I came along <a href="http://freesoundfiles.tintagel.net/Audio/">this site with loads of various sounds</a>, grouped by category and <a href="http://www.pacdv.com/sounds/index.html">these misc sounds</a>. Quite entertaining [try downloading all Beeps, for example [wget -rl 1 &lt;url from page&gt;], and play them after each other in your favorite mediaplayer :)]. I got some SciFi related sites from #morphix on irc.freenode.org too, like this site with <a href="http://www.barbneal.com/trekmisc.asp">misc sounds from the original Star Trek series</a> and <a href="http://www.ajbaker.force9.co.uk/b5images.html">Babylon 5 sounds</a> [doorbell is nice as alarm]. I settled for the Babylon 5 doorbell, but I've quite some sounds in stock to do some cool stuff.</p>

<p>Ah, for good measure, here's an <a href="http://www.stonewashed.net/sfx.html">overview of some sound effects sites</a> too.</p>
