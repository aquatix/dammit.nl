This week, me and my colleagues started using the office again. It's a bit awkward, but also good to see each other in the real again. We keep the amount of people in the space low, so not everybody is here at the same time.

Transparent dividers have been ordered to separate the desks better (a 27" screen does not really cut it), and moving around the room sometimes is a little dance around each other.

Most of my days I will still be working from home, where I have set up a pretty decent ~~nerdcave~~ home office, and which saves travel time (not that biking for about 12 minutes is such a big hassle, even a good way to wake up). Lets see where things go from here.
