<p>Lars Wirzenius from <a href="http://planet.debian.net/">Planet Debian</a> <a href="http://liw.iki.fi/liw/log/2004-03.html#20040321f">makes a good point about valid HTML</a>. He notices that even spammers mostly use validating HTML. So why can't a lot of people on the web? It certainly isn't that difficult, and it says something about the care for your readers/customers when someone or a company puts some little extra effort in a website. Well, an extra effort... It's an extra effort for me to write *non*-validating html :/</p>
