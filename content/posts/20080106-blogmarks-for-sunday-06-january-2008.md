<h3><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/mariner1210.html">You Have No Right to Remain Silent</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Anyone who has ever watched a cop show knows that you have a right to remain silent in response to police questioning, and that if you knowingly waive that right, "anything you say can be used against you in a court of law." The Miranda warnings, named after the 1966 Supreme Court case that gave rise to them, are deeply embedded in both legal and popular culture.</p>

<p>Given the warnings' established place in police procedures, TV cops and real-life police officers might be surprised to learn that the first Miranda right is not a right at all, at least according to the government.</p></blockquote>

<p>Slightly disturbing food for thought</p>
