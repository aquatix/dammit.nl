<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://blog.thedebianuser.org/?p=216">You install it once</a></h3>
<p>The beautiful thing about a Debian install is that you have to perform it only once. Wanna upgrade? Change your /etc/apt/sources.list. Want to stay up-to-date? Change to sid or testing and <code>apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade</code> now and then. Keeps me [being a huge update freak] quite happy :)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/power-management-guide.xml">Power Management Guide</a></h3>
<p>For future reference; things like <code>Option "DynamicClocks" "on"</code> for ATi PowerPlay can be nice</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.fit-pc.com/index.htm">fit-PC - Tiny PC consumes only 5W but runs Win XP and Linux</a></h3>
<p>Nifty little pc, with a Geode processor and based on <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS9996942590.html">this little computer-on-module</a> board.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/blueprint-and-css/">Blueprint and CSS</a></h3>
<p>Maybe useful; a framework for CSS layouts using columns - quite nifty it seems</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8454912761.html">2007 Desktop Linux Survey results revealed</a></h3>
<p>The results of <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=578">The 2007 Desktop Linux Survey I spoke about</a></p>
<h3><a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/23/1219205">The "Loudness War" and the Future of Music</a></h3>
<p>Besides the music lacking all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(music)">dynamics</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war#Remasters">the large amount of compression</a> the mixers performed, why does it all have to be so damn loud?!</p>
<h3><a href="http://blog.thedebianuser.org/?p=203">Linux is easier</a></h3>
<p>I'm still baffled about why people think windows is easier. Even as user I find Linux to Just Work(tm), whereas for windows you need to go hunting the whole internet for drivers, programs, updates and such. Nice for example if you don't have the driver for your network card...</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/">Open Letter To Kansas School Board at Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster - Lack of pirates causing global warming</a></h3>
<p>Be sure to check the numbers in the graph too; it's a satire of all the idiotic broken graphs that you find all over the place in pop pseudoscience and news reporting. Pretty much everything that could be wrong about this graph is wrong. Consider it a reminder that if you're looking at a graph, and it wasn't created by an actual scientist, it probably isn't a great deal better than this.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.gimpusers.com/tutorials/gimp-2-4-new-features.html">GIMP 2.4: The new features - GIMP tutorial - gimpusers.com</a></h3>
<p>Nice stuff!</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic">Apple beats Microsoft at its own Open XML game</a></h3>
<p>Embarrassing indeed! Now, if it supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">Open Document Format</a> too, it'd totally rock ;)</p>
<h3><a href="http://jackshck.livejournal.com/117486.html">Vmware Performance Tuning</a></h3>
<p>For future reference</p>
<h3><a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/07/08/18/1512243.shtml">PC Magazine Editor Throws in the Towel on Vista</a></h3>
<p>Interesting to notice that even a guy that was really interested in vista and positive about it [installed it on all his machines and such], is getting really disappointed and irritated about it after months of usage; a whole bunch of issues still isn't fixed and he finds himself seriously considering dropping windows entirely and migrating to Linux besides his act of stepping down as editor-in-chief for PC Magazine</p>
<h3><a href="http://blog.thedebianuser.org/?p=196">Finally - name-based SSL</a></h3>
<p>For future reference - name-based SSL certificates in Apache [no longer restricted to one domain]</p>
<h3><a href="http://samsarin.com/2007/03/11/gnu-screen-working-with-the-scrollback-buffer/">GNU Screen: Working with the Scrollback Buffer</a></h3>
<p>For future reference - screen is awesome :)</p>
