<p>Well over 400 [some 420 I thought] packages updated/installed, counting up to 200+MB, my poor old laptop sweating to get all installed. Took quite some time [a lot longer then download time] and some fiddling around with packages, but it's done. Then configged some things; will tweak the GUI stuff later. Debian Linux fun =)</p>
<p>Meanwhile Kraftwerk on the radio and artists that sound a little like them. Nice music to work with. [Hm, study...]</p>
