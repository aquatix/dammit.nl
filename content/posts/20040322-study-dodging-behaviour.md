<p>Yay, finally on tracks with <a href="/?section=linux&amp;page=aquamorph">aquamorph</a> again. Last update was somewhere September last year... So now 351 packages are waiting to be updated =)</p>
<p>Lots have changed in the meantime, so I hope it'll still boot nicely when I've found some time to actually make it an iso. Ah well, we'll see.</p>
<p>I just finished reading Stephen King's The Stand. Very interesting book, mainly about the struggle between good and evil in a very interesting environment: an almost completely whiped out population because of some U.S. army made killervirus. Great book.</p>
<p>And now back to reality: I've to study for two exams this week, both math. I like math, but not his math :/ Well, I've to get my Master sometime soon [like, in a year of three], and it'd better be sooner then later... However, I can have lots of fun in the meantime ;)</p>
<p>Back to some serious linux hacking^W^Wstudying.</p>
