<p>Reading Mac Hall today I came along <a href="http://www.machall.com/index.php?strip_id=95">this piece</a>, which could be starring myself. I surely hope I won't do it this week, because I've some serious midterms next week [and have some other things to do too...]. Now I'm off finishing that planning I've been wanting to make all day.</p>
<p>Oh, for those Dutchies travelling by train: <a href="/ns/">check this NS Storingen page</a> I just made. It features a wap page too, so you can finally use that feature of your phone and know what they are up to when your train is doing 0 at the middle of nowhere with noone to explain why.</p>
