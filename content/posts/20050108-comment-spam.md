<p>Gah, why can't they just leave our weblogs alone? Why do those money hungry morons exist? As you may guess I've been getting some comment spam lately. On my self-build weblog. Which sucks. Bigtime, in my eyes.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about some changes to the commenting form for some time already, and will change some things in the Near Future(tm) so you'll have to preview your post first before you can submit. Hope that'll help, otherwise I've to moderate comments, which is against my view on weblogs...</p>

<p>Suggestions?</p>
