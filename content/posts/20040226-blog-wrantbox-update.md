<p>And there it is: shiny and new, well not that new, but it's enhanced. With even more caffeine and stuff. Oh, and free bargain fonts for your OS [not on this site =)]. At least it has a free <a href="blog.rdf">RSS feed</a> for your <a href="http://www.feedreader.com">free windows feedreader</a> or <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/straw/">*nix counterpart</a> [or your own favorite of course]. Wow I sound fscked up :)</p>
<p>Maybe because I slept only a few hour tonight and went to a meeting keeping myself awake with Red Bull(tm). I really got to go to bed sooner [ah who am I kidding :)]. Anyways, I'm going to kill this entry before I can scare even the last reader away from this site =)</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention the enhanced navigation throughout this site? Well, check out the <a href="index.php?page=browse">browse function</a> and the permalinks on each blurp I write.</p>
<p>For those of you wondering where the info on the top of the homepage went [noone? ah well...], it's all on the <a href="about.php">about page</a> now.</p>
