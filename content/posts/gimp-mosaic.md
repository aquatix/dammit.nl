I like taking pictures, and having some of the nicer ones as a background to my daily computer umwelt is a nice extension of this.

Lately, I've been playing around a bit with having pictures show up differently (more abstractly, with less details so they distract less, like those nice clean material designs), and in Gimp I found a way that pleased me, resulting in the images shown here (linking to the gallery).

Open the image in Gimp, then go to menu `Filters > Distort > Mosaic`

Of course, play around with the settings to your own liking.
