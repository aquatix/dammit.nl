<p>And here I am again, at my work. Outside the sun stopped shining. Well, not exactly, luckily, but it's hidden by clouds now. At my desk are the usual computer things and two little boxes with a the better part of 250 business cards with my name on it. And my current phone number. You read the stories about me ordering a new phone? Well, it has a new number too =) So, those brand new cards are obsolete in about a week. Ah well, don't know if I was going to use them extensively anyway, but they are handy at first sight.</p>
<p>We are now testing several hundreds of Flash movies belonging to a training for resellers of products of our client. I'm falling asleep :)</p>
