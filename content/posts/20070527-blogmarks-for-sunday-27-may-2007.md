<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.revfad.com/flip.html">Flip your text upside down</a></h3>
<p>With real characters; utf-8 stuff I guess</p>
<h3><a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004523.html">Language Log: Punctuation, now with heightened indifference!</a></h3>
<p>Interesting post about various odd punctuation characters</p>

<p>Joel on Software on how Microsoft is cutting in their own fingers:</p>

<blockquote><p><p>But what's really interesting about this story is how Microsoft has managed to hoist itself by its own petard. By locking in users and then not supporting <em>their own lock-in features</em>, they're effectively making it very hard for many Mac Office 2004 users to upgrade to Office 2008, forcing a lot of their customers to reevaluate which desktop applications to use. It's the same story with VB 6 and VB.Net, and it's the same story with <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/seekingalpha/070420/32947_id.html?.v=1">Windows XP and Vista</a>. When Microsoft lost the backwards-compatibility religion that had served them so well in the past, they threatened three of their most important businesses (Office, Windows, and Basic), businesses which are highly dependent on upgrade revenues.</p></blockquote>

<p>This eight year old girl tackles some of the weird world views of grownups in the US. Brilliant :)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.chipx86.com/blog/?p=222">Review Board - Reviewing code made easy</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>You're probably familiar with this. A contributor puts a patch up on Bugzilla, Trac, or your project's listserv. Itâ€™s large and spans several files. Eventually you get around to it (if you haven't lost it in your inbox yet). You open an e-mail or the Bugzilla page to respond, put the diff where you can see it, and start going through the changes, line by line, making comments as you go. It's tedious. You have to make it clear what function you're talking about, make references to the general area in the diff. Itâ€™s a pain for the contributor too, because they have to figure out what you're referring to. This leaves room for error.</p></blockquote>

<p>So they created <a href="http://code.google.com/p/reviewboard/">Review Board</a>, an online reviewing tool for patches etc, in which you can easily annotate changed code, to the line. Really nice piece of software</p>
