<p>OK, a shout-out to <a href="http://g1powermac.rozica.com/">g1powermac</a> and <a href="http://galaxycow.com/blogs/vermyndax/">Vermyndax</a>, who seem to be in the path of the Hurricane <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina">Katrina</a>. And of course all others in New Orleans and the rest of her path, because this is going to be one hell of a -- well -- wet hell. <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/08/29/katrina_approaches_n.html">An interesting overview can be found at Boingboing</a>, and I'll certainly keep my eyes out for more information, as it's a huge storm...</p>
