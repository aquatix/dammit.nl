<p>After finding my wallet in time, finding my old bike mysteriously locked and needing to put some air in the tires of my better bike, but still being in time for my train, I got booted out of it two stations down the track needing to buy a ticket because of me forgetting to put back my public transports pass back in the wallet after leaving out all cruft for vacation. *Sigh* ...</p>

<p>And then at work they needed to set up a completely new pc for me to work on. Yay for productivity!</p>
