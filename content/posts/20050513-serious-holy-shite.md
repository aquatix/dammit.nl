<p><a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_Reveals_Xbox_360_Specs/1115954701">Microsoft Reveals Xbox 360 Specs</a>. I had seen those already on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a>, but couldn't believe the triple core PowerPC processors at 3.2GHz. That's more than in the top-of-the-line Apple Powermacs! And that for a measly 300 dollars. If this is hackable, please fix me a Debian install on one of those beasts!</p>
