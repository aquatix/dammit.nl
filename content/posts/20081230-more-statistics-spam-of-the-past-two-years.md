<p>So a few weeks ago I made a graph of the nightly spam-learning events of spamassassin on my Spam folder. I updated it today:</p>

<div class="content-image"><div><a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/images/content/spam_2007-2008.png"><img src="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/images/content/spam_2007-2008_small.png" alt="Spam in 2007-2008" title="Spam in 2007-2008" /></a></div></div>
<br style="clear: both;" />

<p>Of course the graph is clickable for a large version again. It also contains a trend line. You can see the noticeable drop in spam levels in October of this year, when <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/10/14/212253&amp;tid=111">an important spam network was closed</a> (it <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/11/26/1930226">has been back for a while too already</a>).</p>
