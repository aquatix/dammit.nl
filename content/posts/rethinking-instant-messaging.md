Google is abandoning its XMPP instant messaging roots with the switch from Google Talk to Hangouts. For the moment, XMPP (also known as the Jabber protocol) is still working for clients like [pidgin](), but rich messages like images link to Google+ and server federation has been disabled for a while already, making it impossible to send messages to and from Google's network from another XMPP server. Also, real chats (so with more than two participants, generally called a group chat) is not supported anymore through the XMPP interface, so if you want to talk in a group (or really any amount of persons larger than one), you're forced to use the web interface, the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd) or their [web-based Hangouts app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts/knipolnnllmklapflnccelgolnpehhpl?hl=en) (which is a Chrome app). You see the pattern here.

One of the other big players is Skype, property of Microsoft for a few years now. Skype is being a little island of itself, only offering a limited API through its app, so if you want to use another client, it will have to connect through the Skype network through the desktop app, kind of defying the purpose.

Then you have Facebook with its Messenger and Whatsapp.
