<p>I grew increasingly tired changing the column settings of the folders of my IMAP account in Thunderbird; I don't need the 'Read', 'Junk' and 'Thread icon' columns for example, but would like to have the 'Size' listed. However, I needed to change that for all of my dozens of mail folders...</p>

<p>Then I found the following solution (work in Thunderbird 3.1 and up). To apply the current set of columns to all folders:</p>

<ol>
<li>Right-click on the columns</li>
<li>Select "Apply columns to..."</li>
<li>Select "Folder and its children..."</li>
<li>Select the root folder for your account</li>
<li>Done! You have applied the set of columns to all folders in your account.</li>
</ol>

<p>Done!</p>
