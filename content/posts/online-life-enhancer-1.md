Today I want to talk to you about the web and how it sometimes sucks. At least, the experience can suck a bit, especially when it is not open enough so you can set things to your own hands.

Take for example YouTube, where overlays can ruin the end of a clip, you keep fiddling with the quality controls or the zoom levels and so on.

Enter this online life enhancer: [Enhancer for YouTube](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube). This extension for - at the time of this writing - four browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Edge) makes the YouTube experience a lot better.

Like mentioned, it has support to remove overlays (which can be annoyingly in the way), remove ads (with an option to whitelist your favourite channels), it has playback speed control, quality selection, volume level control, auto-pause, preloading settings, pinned and detached player stuff, looping, cinema mode (one of my favourite functions), custom themes and much more.
