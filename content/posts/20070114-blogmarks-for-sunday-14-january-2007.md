<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.robweir.com/blog/2007/01/broken-windows-and-ghost-of-keynes.html">Broken Windows and the Ghost of Keynes</a></h3>
<p>So far for "Windows Vista is going to be really good for our economies!"-talk. I'd rather spend my money on something else than the N-th iteration of some OS that still manages to get in my way when trying to do my work [not even talking about the level of security of this well-known platform and the high-powered computer with hot video card I would have to buy then]. Companies and people would have spend their money anyway, only on other things. Maybe even real goods, which may be an even better way to spend money on, considering the larger view of an economy. Or maybe they would have spend it on software that actually made their life/business processes better. Or on free coffee and soft drinks, which is also quite nice ;)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.robweir.com/blog/2006/01/how-to-hire-guillaume-portes.html">How to hire Guillaume Portes [or, the non-openness of the OOXML file formats]</a></h3>
<p>How is specifying a file format in an over 6000 pages large document to the tiniest details going to result in a document format that's going to be implementable by any other vendor? It's not a specification, it's a DNA sequence. Please read the whole article to see what I mean, it's worth it.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.robweir.com/blog/2007/01/formats-of-excel-2007.html">The Formats of Excel 2007</a></h3>
<p>Sooo... not only is "the" new format Excel uses not entirely open [known for a while: binary blobs in XML can't really be called "open", now can they?], there are several binary formats it can save in, including an *entirely new, non-compatible binary one*. How's that for plain weird and non-open?</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/real-world-to-virtual-world/">Real world to virtual world</a></h3>
<p>A small piece about <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">Apple's iPhone</a>, and using a GUI that acts like the way we handle objects in real life also: no blinking in and out of existence, no need to show a little text with a status update when you can show visually what's happening [e.g., resizing an image for mailing it off]. This is the way computers should work :)</p>

<p>I don't think I'll be buying a phone from Apple, at least not for now, but Apple setting a trend in this kind of interfaces would be really, really nice. I even wrote a little paper about this kind of GUI behaviour for my university :)</p>

<p>Hm, will it go right to fill up the lesser pressure field it creates by sucking up the air along with the air from the rest of the directions?</p>
