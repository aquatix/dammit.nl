After my disappointed [RIP Omnivore]({filename}../posts/rip-omnivore.md) post, I of course started to look around for replacements in general, and one I had a bit more control over, which was for example [Wallabag]() and encountered a ton of bookmarking tools. However, I already have [a bookmarking tool]() and Wallabag is a bit... I don't know, crufty?

A nice thing about Omnivore was the Obsidian plugin which could be configured to download the article content too, so you could search your vault for even the contents of what you read (with less priority in Omnisearch so your own notes weigh more of course).
