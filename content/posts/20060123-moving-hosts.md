<p>OK, I just changed the DNS entry for "aquariusoft.org" to point to my new server, hosted at our place. The old one still stands in a corner of my parents' place, and they grow a bit tired of it. dammIT may be offline for a little while, as it still has to be migrated to the new server, luna.</p>
