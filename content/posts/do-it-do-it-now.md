I stumbled upon [this post by Vermyndax](https://galaxycow.com/2021/12/19/breaking-things-down/) earlier today and felt the urge to type.

His problem is one that I'm familiar with; I don't pretend to have a magic answer, but I learned some tricks to get myself started.

First of all: I don't think it's weird to want to sort-of jump to the end result. It's generally the scratch to some itch, and it better start scratching right now :)

What I learned to do myself, is, well, just start, preferably with something enticing so it is a bit more easy to gear yourself up for it. Ask yourself: "What's needed to set this up?" and then do so right away, instead of drafting a functional design and losing yourself in endless details. Then if there's something blinking Hello World in your face, start adding small things to it. After a while of tinkering you find yourself with something that actually does something more like your intended goal, and then it's 'just' ( :))) ) a matter of iterating. Also, don't fool yourself that a hobby project needs to be 100% done; I don't think they ever will, and as long as the 80% is something usable and fun, you're totally fine.

I have no idea if there's really any coaching on it, apart from the 'getting things done' ways; maybe looking into 'rapid prototyping' or 'agile development' is relevant here. I do believe that minimising the distractions around you and forcing yourself to start is at least one way of putting a potential hobby project into gear.

The next problem was basically overthinking the project, getting lost in a lot of details about *how* to do things instead of doing it.

I suffer the same, and sometimes an idea is marinading for months in the back of my mind until I sit down and act on it. I might do some research in the meanwhile, filling in some gaps of knowledge.

About your brain being scattered... I know the feeling. I think that's part of the "just start" thing here, do not think too much, and when you start doing the little tasks setting up the environment, try not to sidetrack yourself and hopefully some kind of positive feedback loops start hooking you for a bit.

Anyway, that's my ramble about a subject I'm also not all that good in as well, so take it as you like.

Back to work, I guess ^_^
