<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.nrc.nl/opinie/article2316305.ece/Beleefdheid_is_de_meeste_Nederlanders_totaal_vreemd">[Dutch] Beleefdheid is de meeste Nederlanders totaal vreemd</a></h3>
<p>Great piece on politeness and a certain lack of it in the Dutch society. We are used to be and communicate rather directly, which can be unnerving. The student protests in the sixties of the last century have eroded the amount of respect, politeness and such, as there wasn't really some authoritarian weight to through off. Politics of the last decade didn't help too, with politicians saying 'I say what I think'. It's all about how you say those things, people. You can tell something negative, but say it in such a way that it isn't a direct insult.</p>

<p>Really helps understanding and making your argument you know.</p>
