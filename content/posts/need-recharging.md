It's easy to have the blues and be out of energy in these times. Being confined to our homes, changing our ways and lives; not all bad, but a challenge to juggle young kids, work from home and other things.

On the other hand, one might find more free time on their hands because of eliminated home/work travel and such.

I do have a bunch of hobbies, all vying for my time: books, series, gaming (racing, [OpenRA](https://openra.net/) with friends), movies, running, writing software, chatting online, watching random YouTube videos, and quite a bit more, not to forget spending time with my lovely wife. This sometimes leads me to spend more time doing what I love than is good for my (night)rest, especially as my free time still is pretty limited, and mostly consists of a few hours in the evening when the kids have been put in bed.

Having my kids more at home than pre-SARS-CoV-2 is also taking energy, and work has some interesting deadlines looming over me.

All of this means I'm not feeling all that fresh and well-rested, however many morning walks I take to clear the cobwebs from my head. A few days off doing something on my own would be nice, but for now, taking care to get to bed a bit earlier might also be a good way to recharge, at least physical :)
