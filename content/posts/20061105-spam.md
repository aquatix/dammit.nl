<p>Today I reached the 10000 spam email count, not counting my university address. Mind that this is from January first this year, so that makes for an average of 10082/308 = 32,7 spam messages a day. Thanks <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/security/0,1000000189,39167561,00.htm">windows botnets</a>!</p>
