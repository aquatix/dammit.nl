Today was the first day of a new year. 2023 is behind us, but we are not done with the things we started during it. It was a year of both struggles and good times. Sometimes simultaneously.

2024 should be a year of improvements. Improving the situation at home, improving ourselves at work, and the most fun part: getting better at those hobbies we cherish. Looking forward to that, and to laying the foundations of the upcoming years.

Stay healthy, stay sane!

(The fireworks still is strong here BTW)
