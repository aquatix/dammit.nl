<p>Installing [or updating, actually] winxp on a Dell with a cracked screen. Ow, and a b0rked space bar. Why do people always have to abuse pc's? It has such a nice resolution [1400x1050], but it's all fscked up [pictures will follow]. Ow, did I mention the spacebar is fricking b0rked? *sigh*</p>
<p>And why the hell does windows update take one full hour to install 52MB of updates? My Debian sid box does only a few minutes over 250MB...</p>
<p>Ah well, it's finally finished. *gasp* reboot...</p>
