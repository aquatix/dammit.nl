<blockquote><p>Microsoft, say hello to Common Sense. No, you don't know each other, but you should.</p>
<p>The reason that I'm so certain you're not acquainted is because of some of your recent business decisions. I speak first and foremost about your renaming of the Windows Mobile platform. Since you had apparently decided that "Windows Mobile Pocket PC," "Pocket PC Phone," and "Windows Mobile Smartphone" were too--I don't know, helpful? Descriptive?--you selected a new nomenclature for each version: Windows Mobile Classic, Windows Mobile Professional, and Windows Mobile Standard, respectively.</p>
<p>Now, had Common Sense been in the room when you did this, it would have pointed out the following: none of these names make any sense, nor do they convey at all what you're supposed to be buying.</p></blockquote>
