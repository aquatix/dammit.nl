<p>I'm currently sitting in the bar, having finished my Curry Chicken sandwich [well, baguette], and my dose of sugared caffeine [also known as Coca Cola]. The event is turning out really interesting, with too many talks I want to attend. Until I find a way of cloning myself to attend several talks in parallel, I'll have to choose :(</p>

<p>Anyway, we're about to leave to a talk on X.org, so keep you posted ;)</p>
