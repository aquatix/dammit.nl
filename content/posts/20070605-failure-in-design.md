<p>This week, a "Do Not Disturb" sign was hang on every door knob in our street. It was an advertisement for anti-burglary protection. However, this campaign could have very well a negative impact, as for example, a house across our street had it hanging there for two days straight - meaning that its owners wheren't there for that stretch. Nice hint for burglars :)</p>
