<p><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> and MSN search want to <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">stop their search bots from indexing weblog spam</a>. This is nice and all, but won't prevent spammers from poluting our weblogs with their stupid messages at all. It's not that they care about checking for html tags being allowed or blacklists do they? Well, <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/archives/2005/01/nofollow">Anne van Kesteren thinks the same</a>, as does <a href="
http://www.redsplash.de/blog/archives/425-guid.html">this guy</a>. They make some good points too [read the comments on Anne's site too if you're interested].</p>
