<p>Well, there it is: <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/">dammIT's new look</a>. Not only has the layout been overhauled, there's been some technical changes too. Just take a look at the <a href="blogmarks.php">blogmarks</a> page for example [sorted by month etc], or the <em>distracted by</em> piece of the right bar. And of course there are the usual non-visible changes too.</p>
<p>I've been quite busy to get things right [<acronym title="Instant Errors">IE</acronym> made live a lot worse], but now it should look good. Even in lynx if you want. Please let me know what you think of it :)</p>
<p>The art of webdevving is really the art to be patient [when browsers with no notion of <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> play havoc] and to be able to throw away things. The main navigation surely cleaned up mayorly, but you may notice the FAQ page is gone too. It was just a bit lame to have. The <a href="index.php?page=about">about page</a> covers enough. The <a href="blogmarks.php">blogmarks</a> take a lot less space and are more like bookmarks in my opinion. Only a mayor code cleanup awaits, then I'll make an alternative stylesheet :)</p>
