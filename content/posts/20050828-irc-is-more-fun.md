<p>Grab a whisky [Speyside or something], join #morphix at irc.freenode.net and start talking about religion, conspiracies and goverment control. Ah, and history, and Bohemian Rapsody...</p>

<p>Definitaly more fun than <a href="http://talk.google.com/">Google Talk</a> [try connecting with your favorite Jabber client with your gmail account, server 'talk.jabber.com' and port 5222].</p>
