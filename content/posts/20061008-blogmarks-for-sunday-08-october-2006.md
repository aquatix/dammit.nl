<p>This guy really has done some interesting research and stunts based on it:</p>

<blockquote><p class="quote">Thomas' most provocative stunt may have come earlier this year, when he helped a bunch of teenaged schoolgirls set up an <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/Economy/200604030014">online arms dealership</a>. Before long, they were pricing out tanks, negotiating for grenade launchers, and -- in his words -- buying up stun batons and other "equipment intended for torture or ill-treatment."</p></blockquote>
