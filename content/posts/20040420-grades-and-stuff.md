<p>While it's not that bad as <a href="http://blog.sweetvenus.org/2004_04_01_archive.php#108240050363725556">this girl describes</a>, my grades aren't great either. I'm doing some classes now that just aren't interesting, but I want them finished before I go on and do the far more interesting Master courses. Maybe I should have a change of scenery too [move to Amsterdam or something], but I'm still living quite nice at my parents place [pretty cheap and good food ;)]. Ah well, I guess I just have to try harder...</p>
