<p>OK, I figured that when I have to work [or want to do anything productive in general], I should sleep the night before. I went to bed at around 2AM [think it was even later], for the zillionth time the day before I have to work. Luckily, there's such a thing as coffee. Or coke, or Red Bull for that matter. Just anything that ships with caffeine and lots of sugar will do. Thanks for progress.</p>
