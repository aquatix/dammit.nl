<p>Was about to go sleep early yesterday, but I ended up trying to fix a Windows computer at my gf's place that refused to log anyone in. Recovered some files for her sister and brother so they can work on them on other pc's [yay <a href="/?section=linux&amp;page=aquamorph">aquamorph</a> with ntfs read- and usb-storage support :) ]. But now I'm starting to feel quite wasted [not slept longer than 7 hours in more then a week. Ah well :)].</p>
<p>Anybody knows what's happening when you want to login as user [any user] in WinXP home - without password because the users don't have any [sic] - and it logs in and immediately out again?</p>
