> One of usability’s most hard-earned lessons is that <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-priorities/"><em>you are not the user</em></a>. This is why it’s a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/guesses-vs-data/">disaster to guess</a> at the users’ needs. Since designers are so different from the majority of the target audience, it’s not just <em>irrelevant</em> what you like or what you think is easy to use — it’s often <em>misleading</em> to rely on such personal preferences.

The various levels really made me think, as a lot of people in my direct environment are already in the top 5%, which is of course completely out of whack with the levels of most of the population. Even the definition of this 'high computer-related abilities' level is interesting, as in my mind, the skills listed were already pretty basic, albeit above the 'really easy' stuff.

If you want to target a broad consumer audience, it's safest to assume that users' skills are those specified for level 1. (But, remember that 14% of adults have even poorer skills, even disregarding the many who can't use a computer at all.)
