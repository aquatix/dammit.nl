<blockquote><p>EFF closes by proposing a sensible solution -- stop suing fans and figure out how to make money off of their preferred means of acquiring music. To do this, EFF argues that the labels should offer a "blanket license" to fans or ISPs, a flat fee that legalizes downloading music, the proceeds from which can be paid to artists and other rightsholders. This is basically the same system used by radio stations and live venues to legalize their use of music and while it's not without its problems (the collection societies have a history of screwing indie artists and labels, and aggressively expanding their scope to include things like kindergarten classrooms), it sure beats the alternative -- sue, harass and alienate customers.</p></blockquote>

<p>While reading <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/27/183236"> The Agony and Ecstasy Of Becoming a Linux OEM</a>, I came across <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=280823&amp;cid=20380705">this comment</a>, which had some nice links to weblog postings he wrote to get his friend started on Ubuntu. Like he says in a posting before that:</p>

<blockquote><p>When a friend took over my laptop with Ubuntu on it, the first thing she said was that she needed to download her preferred Windows movie player (Somthing like "Gom," I think). The next ten minutes were filled with questions like "Well then, how to I get XXX program to work on it?" There were no "How do I accomplish XXX." Really opened my eyes.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've experienced this too: after having installed a pc with Debian sid with Xfce4 and having explained what the big icon buttons where for, and that there are other programs available in the menu here, I went on my way. The guy is far from a computer literate, and I had installed everything he would need [after interviewing him quite a bit of course]. Then, some weeks later I heard "I couldn't find Limewire and I don't get it installed either", while I had told him to use gnutella instead [with a nice "download stuff with this" menu item]. He also tried installing WinZip on it... After a while he started complaining the pc was getting slower [while at first he marvelled at it's speediness in comparison to the windows install it had before], and eventually bought a new XP machine. /me suspects his weird cable connection to be the cause of "slowness", as nothing changed at the machine. Oh well...</p>

<p>Of course, this is Ubuntu [Gnome] centered, and I like to point people to Xfce4 too, but I think it's a nice start to point new users to.</p>
