<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>

<p>Scary compact program. His goal was 1024, but 1200 is still quite scary (<a href="http://home.hccnet.nl/h.g.muller/max1.html">source available</a> and worth a quick peek)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.snotr.com/video/1926">Monumental Video Projection</a></h3>
<p>Pretty damn cool 3D projections on buildings</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.aegisub.net/2008/12/if-programming-languages-were-religions.html">If programming languages were religions...</a></h3>
<blockquote><p><b>Ruby</b> would be <b>Neo-Paganism</b> - A mixture of different languages and ideas that was beaten together into something that might be identified as a language. Its adherents are growing fast, and although most people look at them suspiciously, they are mostly well-meaning people with no intention of harming anyone.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p><b>Visual Basic</b> would be <b>Satanism </b>- Except that you don't REALLY need to sell your soul to be a Satanist...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice ones :)</p>

<h3><a href="http://vimeo.com/2551523">[Dutch] Apple koopt Ster reclameblok on Vimeo</a></h3>
<p>Old TV advertisement (25 years old) by Apple on the Dutch national TV. It's the Apple Movie preceded by a female presenter lauding the Macintosh and Powerbook (first series, it's so light!). After the Apple Movie in which Jean-Michel Jarre, Niki Lauda and Javier Mariscal tell the world how much they love working with Apple's and being on top of tech and being inspired in their art and such, the presenter proceeds with telling how the public can win one of 25 Powerbooks.</p>
<p>It's quite funny to see the state-of-the-art from then, and the super-sweet (stomachpain inducing) way the woman in the movie converts from not doing `computers' to loving her Apple and all people around it. Quite a fun trip down memory lane :)</p>

<p>Piece about a guy that found a debit card skimming device on one of the payment terminals of our national railway company, took it home and dissected it before turning it in with th police</p>
