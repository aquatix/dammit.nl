<p>Yay for nice domain names! For the non-dutchies among you: we've got some club against swearing here in the Netherlands, which tends to advertise their anti-swearing stance through derogatory and just annoying posters in railway stations [and other places]. I tend to find them annoying, and apparently <a href="http://www.alextreme.org/drupal/?q=node/496">so did Alex</a> :)</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/02/12/why_wireless_carrier.html">Why wireless carriers should be forced into neutrality</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>In "Wireless Network Neutrality," Wu demonstrates the way that the wireless carriers have adopted the same bad practices that led to landmark action against the wire-line phone companies in the middle of the 20th Century. Wu makes a compelling case for changing wireless regulation to require the same minimal neutrality from wireless carriers that wired carriers are currently bound to -- after all, those neutrality rules were responsible for an incredible leap in innovation and telecoms profits. With walled gardens, limits on handsets and handset features, deceptive billing and crummy, fake-ass Internet services, the carriers are slitting their own throats.</p></blockquote>
