<p>I've been playing with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL"><acronym title="eXtensible User-interface Language">XUL</acronym></a> yesterday, and have come up with a rich client for <a href="/page/html/overload">overload feedreader</a>, which you can check in the <a href="/overload/">new snapshot I've put online</a> [log in and choose "Rich client" in the top navigation]. In this snapshot you can now subscribe for a new user also, but still can't add a feed or import an <acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language / feed collection">OPML</acronym> file :)</p>

<p><acronym title="eXtensible User-interface Language">XUL</acronym> enables you to create a rich client, which doesn't need to refresh it's whole window in order to do something. Of course I could have used javascript and XMLHttpRequest in my xhtml frontend, but I prefer to keep my xhtml javascript free and as clean as possible. And learning a new environment [not really a new language, except for the XML format your XUL has to be in] is quite fun ;)</p>
