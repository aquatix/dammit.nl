Summary: About the dammIT weblog, who am I, why do I write


By day, a simple software engineer. By night, also a software engineer.

<h2>Forever beta</h2>
<p>Ok, I've convinced myself I need to have a weblog^Wrantbox too. So what you are looking at is a site being the place to put my frustrations on :) Poluting the web since 2003-12-20!</p>


<h2>"dammIT" ?</h2>
<p>"Damn it" is an often heard phrase when working with computers. Well, at least, I use it a lot when I myself or the software I use do stupid things ;) <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> speaks for itself; my hobby, study and work is all about computers and related stuff: mostly <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym>'es, various software and web development. So, "dammIT" kinda wraps up my life. (Well, not quite, I seem to have a real life too, including my lovely girlfriend^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H<a href="http://inekemichiel.nl">wife</a>, and I'll write about all aspects in my life. Luckily, I do stupid things in the real world too.)</p>


<h2>Why this weblog?</h2>
<p>Yeah, why? Well basically to have some place to write down my frustrations. But also for thinking out loud (which I hope will happen more often than me being frustrated), and sharing some <a href="/m">niceties</a> I found on the web with anybody who cares reading this weblog. So, since the <a href="{filename}../posts/20031220-darn-trains.md">20th of December of the year 2003</a> you can read about me. Oh rejoice :)</p>

<h3>Whoami</h3>
<p>I'm a (backend/full stack) developer with a big media company in the Netherlands. You can find <a href="https://diginaut.net">more information about me on diginaut.net</a>.</p>

<p>/me has been a student <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.vu.nl/">Vrije Universiteit</a> in Amsterdam and working with the Royal Dutch Navy, where I did my Master research project too. <a href="https://aquariusoft.org/">aquariusoft.org</a> is home to my projects. You can also find links to other sites, like <a href="https://shuttereye.org/">my gallery</a> there. Even <a href="https://github.com/aquatix">more projects can be found on my GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3>You seem to be a Dutchie. Why do you pretend to write English?</h3>
<p>Mainly because of the exercise I get through it. I like reading other weblogs, preferably in a language I understand, which boils down to Dutch and English. As most content I consume nowadays is in English, I choose to write in that language too. And now I get a reader or three extra ;)</p>


<h2>This weblog</h2>
<p>I started this website before software like Wordpress became usable (or even existed) and also because I liked to write such a content management system. Maybe I'll find versions of the code from the time period between 2003 and 2006, but I started version control in 2006 so the <a href="https://github.com/aquatix/dammit">dammIT sourcecode</a> that <a href="">I published on Github for everyone to see</a> starts its history there.</p>

<p>In <a href="{filename}../posts/20100913-a-new-domain.md">September 2010 it moved to its own domain</a> and it has been here ever since.</p>

<p>As of <a href="{filename}../posts/moved-to-pelican.md">April 2017</a> the codebase has been switched to use <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, a static site generator, as I have been tired of PHP for a while. <a href="https://github.com/aquatix/dammit.nl">The content now lives in this GitHub repository</a>. The theme is <a href="https://github.com/aquatix/voidy-bootstrap">a fork</a> of <a href="https://github.com/robulouski/voidy-bootstrap">voidy-bootstrap</a> with some enhancements like the green/olive theme, neighbour articles navigation and <a href="https://posativ.org/isso/">isso</a> commenting support.</p>

<h3>Bugs, issues, features?</h3>
<p>As the <a href="https://github.com/aquatix/voidy-bootstrap">theme source is open</a> and I like to hear your suggestions, you <a href="https://github.com/aquatix/voidy-bootstrap/issues">can file tickets</a> with your findings. If you happen to use my code, I'm even more interested in your opinion.</p>

<p>If you find strange things or dead links in my posts that you are able to fix, <a href="https://github.com/aquatix/dammit.nl">you can file a pull request</a> for the content too :)</p>
