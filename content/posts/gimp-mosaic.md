I like taking pictures, and having some of the nicer ones as a background to my daily computer shenanigans is a nice extension of this.

Lately, I've been playing around a bit with having pictures show up differently (more abstractly, with less details so they distract less, like those nice clean material designs), and in Gimp I found a way that pleased me, resulting in the images shown here.

Open the image in Gimp, then go to menu `Filters > Distort > Mosaic`, and tweak the settings to:

- Tile size 15 or 20.
- Tile height 2,000
- Tile neatness 0,650
- Tile color variation 0,100
- Tile spacing 0,000
- Joints color: HTML notation 666666
- Light color: ffffff
- Light direction 135,00
- Random seed 0

Of course, play around with the settings to your own liking.
