<p>So, exactly two weeks after <a href="http://dammit.nl/p/895">my previous post about me running out of contract</a>, I went applying for a job at the second company I was aiming at (in no particular order of wantedness). The meeting was quite pleasant and after surprising me with a question about SciFi after a lot of technical and other on-topic questions, we got along quite well already. This resulted in me getting an offer immediately, which of course increased my happiness level to a much higher rating than it had be sitting at lately.</p>

<p>I'll be wrapping up and handing off my work here until the end of the year and will be starting afresh in January. Really looking forward to it already!</p>
