<p>So, basically I'm busy studying for some re-examinations I've to do the next two weeks. But, you know, studying on the same desk as your internet connected pc just doesn't work. At least not for me. IRC is just too tempting, as is reading the backlog of mailings and the daily dose of blog updates. Ow, and downloading some new versions of opensource or just free programs for my palm, looking for a nice USB key. And not to forget: tidying up my fricking room. WTF? I have to *study*, otherwise I don't get that grade. Ever. OK, now I've figured that out, I figure I should stop writing this rant too.</p>
