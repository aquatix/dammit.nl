<p>Yep, you read that right, I'm working on <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/linux/aquamorph/">my aquamorph livecd</a> again. The hardest part is configuring the <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce4</a> environment to my likings [especially filling the panel with stuff], and rewriting the manual. Configuration nears its end, and I hope to have the manual written at the end of the week. So, instead of half december, I may have an aquamorph v0.3 at the end of January.</p>
