<p>For those among you who gave up on my photolog because of the lack of updates, <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/photolog/2008/03/07/silence/">check the latest update</a>. I've not had the time to make and post quality pictures, so I preferred not posting instead. I could have said so though ;)</p>

<p>I'm certainly planning on posting more to it, only no pics-a-day anymore. Be sure to check it now and then.</p>
