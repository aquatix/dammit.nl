With a whole load of things being the new 'normal', wishing y'all a 'normal 2022' might not sound like how I intend it to. What I mean is, lets hope we get more of the normal that we were used to before that little virus found its way across the seven seas.

One of the things that kept me sort-of sane was blabbering in this litte rantbox, so I will surely be doing more of that in the upcoming year.

For now, lets enjoy some time with our loved ones, some well-earned downtime (if possible) and maybe a booster shot.

Happy normal 2022 everyone!
