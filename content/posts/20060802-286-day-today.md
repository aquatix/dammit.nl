<p>OK, this is a real geek speaking, but the upcoming days present a nice numeric sequence other geeks will appreciate [except when you're <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC">not a fan of this platform</a> ;)]: 2/8/6 today, 3/8/6, 4/8/6, 5/8/6 and 6/8/6 the following days, representing the various iterations of the x86 platform :)</p>

<p>And let's not forget the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80186">186</a>, which saw the light in 1982, running at 6MHz, which represent two interesting numbers for me [the first being my year of birth, second being kind of a lucky number to me].</p>
