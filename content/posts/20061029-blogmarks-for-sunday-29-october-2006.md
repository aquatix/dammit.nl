<h3><a href="http://roguejeff.com/rogue-elephants-in-the-ny-times/">Rogue Elephants in the NY Times</a></h3>
<p>Strangely human actions from elephants, rolled up into an interesting article ...</p>

<blockquote><p>... on new developments with rogue elephants â€” they rape and kill rhinoceroses; attack villages with intelligent measures like blocking escape routes and pinning down humans before goring them to death; and display psychological traits previously only observed in people.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://brok3n.org/archivesextreme/2006/10/dropping_the_ad.html">Dropping the addiction that is irc</a></h3>

<h3><a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/firefox-2/geek-to-live-top-firefox-2-config-tweaks-209941.php">Top Firefox 2 config tweaks</a></h3>
<p>A bunch of handy Firefox tweaks, most for version 2, which I kinda like, besides it not being in Debian sid yet and having a non-native look of the tabs they use. I like desktop-integration, so I like my programs to look the same. Oh well, rest looks nice ;)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/23/getting_out_your_gui.html">Getting Out: Your Guide to Leaving America</a></h3>
<blockquote><p> Now that habeas corpus and other basic rights, including the right not to be tortured while interrogated, have now been deemed unnecessary, more Americans than ever have been thinking of getting out the door while they still can.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the decreasing care that's being put in kids toys. Or toys in general, if I may put so...</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/23/scientific_american_.html">Scientific American Mind on Paul Ekman and microexpressions</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The professor calls the ever present risk we all take of misreading a person's visage "Othello's error." In Shakespeare's drama, Othello misinterprets the fear in his wife Desdemona's face as a sign of her supposed infidelity. In truth, the poor woman is genuinely alarmed at her husband's unjust, jealous rage. Othello's subsequent decision to kill Desdemona is a fatal error, and Ekman wants to make sure that police, security personnel and secret service agents do not make the same mistake. "Arresting the guilty is a good thing," he acknowledges, "but decreasing the number of innocent people who are falsely accused is just as important."</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.osnews.com/permalink.php?news_id=16251&amp;comment_id=173735">About Linux deployment manageability</a></h3>
<p>Here this Open Source operating system shows its strengths: manage it the way *you* [system administrator] wants, not the way Microsoft wants you to. For people who look further than short term, Microsoft's solutions just don't look all that good and well-priced.
