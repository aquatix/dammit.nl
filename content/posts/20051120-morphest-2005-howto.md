<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks,</p>

<p>as Morphest 2005 is drawing near, you would certainly want some
additional information about what, how, where, when and why.</p>


<h2>WHAT</h2>

<p>Having fun, doing some Morphix stuff, getting to know each other better,
drooling on gadgets, drinking beer, drinking more beer while partying in
Amsterdam and generally having some fun.</p>


<h2>HOW</h2>

<p>Our base will be my and my girlfriend's apartment. I've thought about
the best way to reach us, and I think that'll be by train, as that's by
far the cheapest way. I'm borrowing a car, so we can move stuff quite
easily. Please have a look at the Morphest 2005 page for more information.</p>

<p>So, how?</p>

<p>First, I'd need to know what flights you're on and when these are
planned to arrive. As can be seen on the Morphest page, three of you
will arrive at Saturday morning [if I get my facts straight]. I want to
pick you up at Schiphol, where we will assemble and then take the train
to a station nearby our home [tickets are about 3.20 Euro pp -- a lot
cheaper than a cab], where we will travel the last bit by car.</p>

<p>Alex and Jure: I think it may be an idea when Alex will pick Jure up at
Schiphol and you both travel by train to Uitgeest station, where I will
pick you up? Jure can buy a ticket with reduction. Please let me know
what you think.</p>


<h2>WHERE</h2>

<p>[I'd rather not post my full address online]</p>


<h2>WHEN</h2>

<p>Well, from Saturday 26 till Tuesday the 29th of November officially.
Jure [gandalfar] and Alex will arrive at Friday the 25th and help
me doing some groceries and setting up some stuff [right? ;)].
Tuesday will mostly be spent departing. Ideas for what to spend our time
on are welcome  :)  At this moment, only partying through the night of
Saturday till Sunday dawn is on the list.</p>


<h2>WHY</h2>

<p>The same as for Morphix: Just For Fun(tm), for taking over Europe and
the world, and to drink beer, of course.</p>


<h2>OTHER STUFF</h2>

<ul>
<li>Should I create a local Debian mirror on my server beforehand?</li>

<li>Please let me know when you arrive, and your flight numbers when relevant.</li>

<li>Olivier: will you inform Marc? When are you planning to arrive?</li>

<li>We seem to have enough sleeping material, except for maybe a mattress.
Maybe Olivier and Marc can bring something?</li>

<li>More information at the well known, and just updated
<a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/linux/morphest2005/">http://aquariusoft.org/page/linux/morphest2005/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If something is still unclear, please let me know.</p>


<p>Cheers and looking forward to it,<br />
Michiel Scholten, aquatix @ #morphix</p>
