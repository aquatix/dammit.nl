<p>Well, this certainly is a busy week. Been studying all day at Monday, working at Tuesday, hardcore TCP and HTTP progging at Minix at Wednesday. Then got quite drunk at a party of the Biology department. This morning I woke up without a hangover, but not quite awake [a little more asleep then usual]. Then send an SMS message to the wrong person and tried to learn with my sleepy head. I'm now cleaning up the TCP and HTTPx code so I can submit it soon. Only have to finish the documentation yet.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'm going to work all day, and Saturday is the same, apart from the fact that I'm celebrating my 22nd birthday tomorrow, while I'm actually upgrading to that age at Saturday :)</p>
<p>I'm off now finishing that damn code and then I'll enjoy some well earned sleep. Or so I hope.</p>
