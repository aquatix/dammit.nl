Tips and thoughts on preparing and giving engaging presentations.

As a person who does not give presentations often (lots of reasons), the points and pointers in this article sound really helpful.

Also, one of the better explanations about why a full, information dense slide is unhelpful:

> Now imagine the audience when one of these dense slides comes up. I start explaining how things work, but the audience is busy trying to parse what’s in the slide. They’ve completely tuned me out because that’s what happens. (Have you ever noticed that when you start reading an email when your spouse is talking you completely lose track of what they’re saying until they clap you across the side of the head? The same thing happens in presentations (minus the head shot); we process language in a single thread and can’t possibly maintain concentration on the speaker’s words when there are a lot of other words to process on a slide.)
