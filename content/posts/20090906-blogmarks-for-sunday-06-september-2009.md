<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://home.znet.com/schester/calculations/analysis_of_rate_of_rare_problems.html">Analysis of Rate of Human Problems</a></h3>
<p>Good article on probability and how we handle it with regards to our problems</p>
<h3><a href="http://blog.shelfari.com/my_weblog/2009/09/neil.html">Shelfari: Neil Gaiman's Bookshelves</a></h3>
<p>Neil Gaiman's gorgeous personal library. One day I want such a one of my own.</p>
<h3><a href="http://projects.haskell.org/bluetile/">Bluetile - a modern tiling window manager with a gentle learning curve</a></h3>
<p>Interesting project, as it integrates with a familiar desktop environment. Still doesn't look that slick though. I think Compiz should learn some tiling management tricks, that'd be great.</p>
<h3><a href="http://webdesignledger.com/tips/the-definitive-guide-to-about-me-pages">The Definitive Guide to About Me Pages</a></h3>
<p>Some good tips. I'm not too sure about putting a picture of yourself on there too; I've had a few times that I was completely put off by one. But maybe that's a good filter too :)</p>
<h3><a href="http://blog.backblaze.com/2009/09/01/petabytes-on-a-budget-how-to-build-cheap-cloud-storage/">Petabytes on a budget: How to build cheap cloud storage</a></h3>
<p>Cool piece of tech; also really decent article, where everything is explained and listed. Good stuff.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,643702,00.html">High-Tech for the Kitchen: Scientists Develop Intelligent Coffee Mug</a></h3>
<p>Good stuff. Interesting material btw, that phase change material (PCM)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.downloadmoreram.com/">Download More RAM!</a></h3>
<p>Damn handy! Seems to have replaced my 8GB with 4GB though :(</p>
