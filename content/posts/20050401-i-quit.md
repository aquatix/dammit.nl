<p>I'm quitting. I'm leaving my computer related job, I stop studying Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/">Vrije Universiteit</a> as I'm through with it, I stop working on my darned web projects. Most likely I'll say goodbye to the <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a>' community. I'll power down my pc's and go doing something else.</p>

<p>Seriously, I have had it with all these electronics. They suck up too much energy. From me, from the powergrid, sucking up lots of time either. I'll <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/10/18/exit">find a hobby [and life] that doesn't involve electronics</a>. See you all later.</p>

<p>Time for a beer, be it an early one.</p>
