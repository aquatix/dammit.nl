<p>Merry Christmas to you all! Even when you don't celebrate it, a good weekend to you!</p>
<p>I'm currently listening to <a href="http://www.8bitpeoples.com/discography_gfx.php#8BP038">the Christmas album</a> of the <a href="http://www.8bitpeoples.com/">8bitpeople</a>; quite an extraordinairy work of synthesizer music from old 8 bits [game]computers. You can download their music from the website, so check it out and rejoice in the sounds of times not that long past :)</p>
<p>Those vintage sounds just make me happy, as does the fact that I'm the proud owner of an appartment now. Well, not owner, renter, but it's my first own home ever, and <a href="http://www.woonopmaat.nl/dynamic/PlattegrondTypeDetailsUitgebreid.aspx?PlattegrondtypeNummer=1422A">it's great</a> [Dutch link with groundplan]. More on that later!</p>
