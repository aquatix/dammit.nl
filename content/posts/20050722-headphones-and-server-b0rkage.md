<p>OK, so my server was down from about 11PM yesterday to 15PM today [GMT+1 and DST], which was caused by general hardware b0rkage. I don't know why, but the two newest drives in it go berserk now and then. Maybe a leftover from the broken motherboard that used to be in it...</p>

<p>Aaanyway, I've still not posted my little vacation-story, which I'll try to do tomorrow, including some pictures. If no pictures, then still story. I should just post the darn thing ;)</p>

<p>What I've been doing this week is basically: working and looking for some good headphones for travelling and listening music behind a pc. I've kinda settled on the <a href="http://www.sennheiser.com/sennheiser/icm_eng.nsf/root/05207">Sennheiser PX200</a>, which are decently small, can be folded quite neatly into a carrying case and are comfortable [I hope, I should find a store where I can test them]. Sennheisers aren't as good as they used to be, except for some of them, including the PX200 I heard [reading some reviews give mixed results, basically saying the bass of the PX200 isn't pronounced enough. Having heard some Sennheisers, I think that may even be a good thing].</p>

<p>I don't want to wear those huge headphones, and even the other Sennheisers are a bit large to my taste [at least for wearing them on the street], but I'm willing to consider such a model when having a very decent sound.</p>

<p>So, anybody has some recommendations?</p>
