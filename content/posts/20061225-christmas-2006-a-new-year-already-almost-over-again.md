<p>... and time flies. While enjoying the company of close ones and the food and drinks they serve, I can't help but contemplating a bit about another year gone by. Did I accomplish the things I wanted to do? Did I live up to the expectations of the people around me? I'm doing my best and jotting down some new and old goals for the next year.</p>

<p>Happy few last days of ol' 2006 all of you! That those who celebrate it, may have a very merry and happy Christmas, whether you actually are a Christian or not :)</p>
