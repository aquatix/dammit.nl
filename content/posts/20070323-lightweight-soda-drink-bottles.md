<ol>
<li>Open closet door</li>
<li>Notice how all empty bottles come crashing down on you</li>
<li>Sigh and try to stuff them back on the shelf</li>
<li>Start to get more annoyed because they won't stay upright</li>
<li>Direct some angry kicks inside the closet</li>
<li>Find that this doesn't solve your problem</li>
<li>Patiently [while fuming] set all bottles upright again</li>
<li>Close closet door</li>
<li>Stare at still empty glass</li>
<li>Open closet door</li>
</ol>

<p>[The previous generation of those things where a little bit heavier, and *actually stayed upright* when a slight breeze went past them - like, when you open the closet door...]</p>
