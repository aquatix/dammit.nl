I remember writing (yes, writing) short weblog updates in the train on my Sony Clie running PalmOS, using the fast glyphs of Graffiti, in 2004. I want to go back to that, realising that my weblog had turned into a collection of longer articles as of late, spaced quite far apart. Nothing with with that, but it's slow, other things have priority over writing and I kinda miss a platform to just braindump on, however much fun [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@diginaut) is.
