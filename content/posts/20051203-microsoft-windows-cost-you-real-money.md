<p>... even when you've bought it already. Let me explain: when you shut down the operating system on your computer [say, your laptop], you expect it to power down the hardware. So when you close the lid of your laptop while it's shutting down, everything is fine. Except when you wake up next morning to be greeted with a nice Bluescreen, which means your laptop has been powered on all evening and night. That just happened with my girlfriend's laptop. So, no power saving mode, no nothing, only wasting energy and hardware. Thanks, microsoft, real thanks.</p>
