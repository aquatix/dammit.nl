<p>And finally I'm doing something different at work. I'm coding in Delphi again [it seems that a long time ago I was actually rented as Delphi programmer, but I've done almost every modern programming language since :) ]. HTTP uploading/downloading of large files. Kinda interesting and refreshingly different from thinkering with Java, PHP and *gasp* Flash.</p>
<p>It seems that almost everybody [some 35 persons out of 42] are going to snowboard next Friday at the team building trip to the indoor skiing resort Snowworld at Zoetermeer [The Netherlands]. And most of them are going to take the lessons, so I'm not the only one that's going to crash my way down =) Now only if I could find a suitable skiing pants...</p>
