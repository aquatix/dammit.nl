<p>As you may know, I'm a gadget freak^Wlover. So, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> is one of the sites I've featured in my super1337 <acronym title="RDF Site Summary">RSS</acronym> <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">aggregator</a>. Todays harvest is a nice one; lets start with the first thing I would want to have for my [hypothetical] own house: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/8806815268281114/">a kitchen sink</a>. Well, it's a washbasin, but whatever. Second, I would like to hook <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1511842317451507/">this sucker</a> up into my home network. Hope it won't get hacked. Maybe I can hook up <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/6843941284115839/">one of these</a> too. As I've a girlfriend [one hell of a gadget :)], I will <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/2522842317451596/">skip</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1128258613636671/">these</a>. And no, even when we get kids sometimes, I won't buy them <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/3092323777711756/">these</a>... For those people that envy the dudes with the tweaked cars, but are stuck with a bicycle themselves, you can <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/6054163417338263/">beef</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/9153726625183572/">those</a> up too. I'll take <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/9546544886697411/">this alternative vehicle</a> instead. It gets weirder from here on. You can try communicating via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/3240247581392225/">LED arrays</a> or be communicated to one way [not yours], by <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/9660112788933191/">supernifty ad enhancement gadgetry</a>. Of course, they won't sell <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7547889465611867/">these</a> to any sensible women [sorry focks, ain't gonna happen I'm afraid - just asked my girlfriend]. Singing <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/8276385639551585/">this song</a> to them won't help either.</p>
<p>With all electronic gear gathering around the power outlets, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/8142616514972351/">you can relieve your bills a bit by walking around</a>. For several hours. A day.</p>
