<p>Until I fix my blogmarks section I've to post nice links here. Here it goes: <a href="http://www.8bitpeoples.com/discography_gfx.php#8BP038">Christmas music from various 8bit video games</a>, 8 people made 8 different songs on 8 different 8 bit computers [yeah, golden oldies :)]. Now *that's* nice Christmas music. Eat that Mariah Currysoup :P</p>
