<p>I'm a bit pissed. When I thought I was done with all my courses, I started adding things up and now I'm missing out on some ECTS points [the credit points you get by successfully passing a course], because the conversion between the old and the new ways of assigning points. So, instead of 180.1 ECTS for 3 years of Bachelor, I suddenly have only 179.3. So I'll have to do some black magic with re-arranging courses in the free-choice space, but then I'm missing out on points for my Master. And that sucks, as I want to start my Masters project Real Soon Now(tm). Meh.</p>

<p>Also, my ADSL connection keeps dropping randomly, and reconnecting takes about 15 seconds. Thank the Light I have a decent Linksys router to keep connections alive.</p>

<p>And now the power supply of my speaker set has party died too, so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_More_Loud_Music">no more loud music</a> to drown out the highly energised kiddos in the house above me...</p>

<p>On the bright side, I have really decent Sennheiser PX-200 headphones, isolating out the noise around me. Also, I managed to get <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/v/photographs/homepics/p9240019.jpg.html">a dual monitor setup working on my laptop</a> yesterday. Using the xserver-xorg-video-ati driver [version 6.7.194 from Debian experimental], and <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Xorg_RandR_1.2">the good info on RandR 1.2 at Think Wiki</a>, I now have both the 1400x1050 screen of my laptop, and the 1600x1200 resolution of my 19" CRT to be spent by my xfce4 desktop. Really nice :)</p>
