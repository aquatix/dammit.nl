<p>I hate it when my browser goes belly up on me. It shows how dependent I've become on the thing. Thank $DEITY it happens only twice a year or something, but it just happened to me. I only had about 35 tabs open [all very interesting stuff, really], and then I did a Ctrl+Shift+Tab to go back a tab and it just started eating CPU cycles. It's doing it for some minutes now, so my hope on it recovering itself is gone. That's a quick killall firefox-bin then, but that means I loose my opened tabs [all really interesting stuff I wanted to use for this blog, really]. So...</p>

<p>I killed Firefox and went straight to opening my <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">bloglines</a> page again. Good that they support showing all posts from now till NN hours ago. So, opened the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">engadget</a> feed again for some new creepy/neat/scary/cool stuff. First <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/5574793157179014/">this creepy robocat</a>. I guess our cat is cooler in that it knows how to open doors and jump on your bed when he thinks you're supposed to wake up. Talking 'bout my bedroom: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/6436666232365312/">this rug</a> would be a really neat add-on, in contrary to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/3463704371424571/">this kinda cute Kenny inspired webcam</a> or this <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/2622953428663728/">creepy Japanese sleep doll</a>. I hate it when I don't wake up myself. Talking about creepy and Japanese: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/8817137592524569/">this robot has to secure shopping malls</a>. Check out the captions in the reactions on the article. I'd rather have <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/0894670691389870/">one of these build-it-yourself robots</a>. Now if I didn't have a nice Sony PDA and cellphone already, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/3114445122366423/">this Samsung</a> PalmOS based cellphone would surely be one of my items of choise. Combine that with <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7302177097575165/">Caller ID spoofing</a> [too bad it's only in the US] and I would have a lot more fun on my daily train rides. Another neat gadget [too bad it's from microsoft], is <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/3868766997708411/">this designer optical mouse</a>.</p>

<p>To make sure that you fully are aware that Japanese people are weird, they invented the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1365040959537038/">boyfriend arm pillow</a>. I surely hope that it won't a big hit with the ladies there, otherwise I would heartily agree with all those Japanese men playing Hentai games... They would have to go to great deals for impressing the ladies with stuff like <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7829473261537815/">this gold-plated transformer robot thingee</a>.</p>

<p>In other news, people try to get themself killed in <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/3487363383872473/">a jet-powered wheelchair</a>, on a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7931595493861250/">sideways mooving bicycle</a>, eating sushi with <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/4733952417440485/">these glasses</a> and in a <a href="http://www.hedkace.org/cool_random_stuff/castin.mov">very funny casting movie</a> [quicktime, rightclick, save].</p>

<p>Anyways, do I have other things to write about except a shitload of gadgets? Sure. Here in The Netherlands, we had the government financing projects where people could buy computers and computer gear and get a tax refund calculated with their salary and stuff. Anyways, it's purpose was to make everybody able to purchase a PC. Everybody with a job that is, but whatever, because they pulled the plug out of it. Now, everybody seems to think this is bad [whole companies depend on large companies doing their yearly "pc-prive project" as it's called], but I think it has it's good sides. First, people now don't go out and buy expensive, sometimes crappy, computers with windows preinstalled. They won't stop buying computers [like the media are shouting], but they of course will want to spend less on them. So, lots of people will turn to their hardware savvy nephew/son/neighbour/alien-of-choise to build a cheap-but-capable pc for them. Now, if those computer savvy people are smart and _don't_ pirate microsoft software but instead tell everybody how freaking expensive windows, office and all those anti-virus software is, people will begin to start looking for alternatives. Of course, few will immediately dump windows [they want to continue playing the Sims and stuff], but at least they will look at software like <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> and [if those internet savvy nephews push it right] <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>. If enough people are liking those cross-platform programs, they are more likely to try out other <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym>'es where they can use the same bundle. Like GNU/Linux and the BSD's. And then the world will slowly start looking better again, because we will be spammed less by trojan-infected non-patched [or even patched] windows machines. And being asked about getting hardware working with GNU/Linux sounds more fun to me then cleaning up a windows system from spyware and bots for the third time in a week. I've stopped doing that a long time ago.</p>
<p>There's a downside to lots of people switching to GNU/Linux. It won't be cool to run it anymore. However, it will still be a very more convenient environment to do your work in than whatever windows flavour you're trying to run.</p>

<p>And then a short blurp about sports. Yesterday while reading the free Metro newspaper in the metro to my work, I scanned the letters readers had send them [always a good source of entertainment]. There was one from a sports hater. He complained about the solution from our government that they want to push sports [like in the US] and that there's so much sport on television. I agree a bit with him. I'm no sport hater [I love to watch women basketball], but the overkill on football on television starts anoying me. Like I want to watch football the whole summer [first the European Championship and then football in Athens. Like I care. Just give me those gymnasts and swimmers]. I think it's a good idea to push sports a little more on schools, but please let the scholars choose for themselves. And don't push football anymore. Try basketball instead or something. And put that on the telly. Maybe I will start looking at that thing again then.</p>
