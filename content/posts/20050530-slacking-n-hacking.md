<p>Did some studying today for an exam I have in about a day now. It's quite boring, but I need to focus as I want to get it's freaking grade...</p>

<p>Anyhow, I've been hacking a bit at <a href="/overload/">overload</a> too. I've updated <a href="/page/html/overload/">the overload project page with a roadmap</a> [heheh, feeling lucky?] and temporarily disabled the public version of the reader, as I'm overhauling the database a bit. I found some interesting ideas in <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/05/28.html#a10235">a post by Robert Scoble</a>, and some more <a href="http://scoblecomments.scripting.com/comments?u=1011&amp;p=10235&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fradio.weblogs.com%2F0001011%2F2005%2F05%2F28.html%23a10235">in the comments</a>. As such, I came along <a href="http://blogs.iloha.net/ryochiji/entries/2892.shtml">FeedMuncher</a> and <a href="http://www.bloxor.com/">Blox0r</a>, from which the latter interested me the most. They both use some good ideas about the interface design, and I'll surely incorporate some of the <acronym title="eXtensible User-interface Language">XUL</acronym>  interface [ideas] of bloxor into my own rich client frontend, as it's quite tight.</p>

<p>Basically I'm thinking about implementing tags for items [and feeds?], adding those as semi-groups. I want to do the same for filters [which will be based on keywords and/or dates; "funny,microsoft" would be an example of a keyword filter and "max 1 day old" would be an example of a date-based filter. Maybe anybody has some other ideas?]</p>

<p>I'm starting to think about using that javascript based Ajax after all in the xhtml version. I wanted it to be pure html, and have the <acronym title="eXtensible User-interface Language">XUL</acronym> interface as rich experience, but I find the xhtml version a bit sluggish...</p>

<p>BTW, for people who use windows now and then: <a href="http://www.curiostudio.com/feature.html">GreatNews</a> seems like a quite nice standalone RSS reader too. I've already borrowed it's 2-column style for <a href="/overload">overload</a> [you can choose for normal or 2-column style now]. <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/various/20050528_greatnews_rss_reader">A picture tells more</a>. And it doesn't need .NET! [It uses IE as embedded browser however, but they seem Firefox fans]</p>

<p>I just set up a webmail frontend for my server too, as my girlfriend requested one. I came along <a href="http://blog.ilohamail.org/">ilohamail</a> today [from the same author as FeedMuncher it seems], and it suits me just fine; it's neatly set up and just works [well, after I tweaked my imap daemon a bit, security was set too tight to allow webmail].</p>
