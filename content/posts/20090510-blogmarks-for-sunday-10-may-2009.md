<h3><a href="http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html">A Brief, Incomplete, and Mostly Wrong History of Programming Languages</a></h3>
<p>Awesomeness</p>

<blockquote><p>1983 - Bjarne Stroustrup bolts everything he's ever heard of onto C to create C++. The resulting language is so complex that programs must be sent to the future to be compiled by the Skynet artificial intelligence. Build times suffer. Skynet's motives for performing the service remain unclear but spokespeople from the future say "there is nothing to be concerned about, baby," in an Austrian accented monotones. There is some speculation that Skynet is nothing more than a pretentious buffer overrun.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/04/21/fuck-the-foundries">Fuck the foundries (and use fonts you can actually... use)</a></h3>
<p>Professional fonts may be really neat, beautiful, complete (UTF8 character set) and such, but what use is that if people can only use it offline, while so much publications are online nowadays, reaching 2 billion people?</p>
<h3><a href="http://nymag.com/news/business/55687/">How Michael Osinski Helped Build the Bomb That Blew Up Wall Street</a></h3>
<p>Interesting background story on the guy that 'wrote the software that turned mortgages into bonds.' It also helps putting things into perspective. Great read.</p>

<h3><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8027650.stm">Shedding light on the Catacombs of Rome</a></h3>
<p>Great 3D technology used to map the underground worlds of the catacombs in Rome in 3D, with fullcolour photographs</p>
<h3><a href="http://brassgoggles.co.uk/blog/200904/the-mikiphone-precursor-to-the-i-pod">The Mikiphone: Precursor to the i-pod?</a></h3>
<p>Awesome little device: a miniature gramophone.</p>

<blockquote><p>All the parts apart from the winding handle are stored inside the case which when closed has a diameter of just 4.5" (11.5 cm) by under 2" thick (4.7 cm). The turntable is only just over 4" in diameter (10.4 cm) and the records are held in place with a push on clamp. The celluloid 'horn' is in two parts and is also stored within the case.</p></blockquote>
