<p>Groklaw on the issue</p>

<blockquote><p class="quote">Microsoft is not checking our hard drive serial numbers to provide web page flow, convey usage demographics, or confirm user input, unless they are also perusing the contents of our hard drives, which they claim they are not. Of course, once they are inside your computer, there's really nothing much stopping them, if they felt like it. So why does Microsoft collect information like that and what are they doing with it? The above statement surely isn't all. They don't need such information about you as your hard drive's serial number, the company that built your computer, what language you use, PID/SID, Bios information with an MD5 checksum, and where you are located to do any of the three things they say they are doing it for. Obviously, they are checking to know if you are a pirate, and they should say so straightforwardly. But does Microsoft need your hard drive serial number to know if you are a pirate? If you change it, is it any of Microsoft's business? Did they sell you that hard drive? But my point is, it's not mentioned in the EULA at all, so I don't see consent having been given. But it gets worse.</p></blockquote>
