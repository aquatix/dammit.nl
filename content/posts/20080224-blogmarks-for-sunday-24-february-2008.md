<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.nu.nl/news/1446598/122/rss/Den_Dikken_trouwt_Den_Dunnen.html">[Dutch] Den Dikken trouwt Den Dunnen</a></h3>
<p>Just some random funny Dutch news about a woman with a family name that roughly translates to 'the big-boned one' [ ;) ] marries a man with a family name 'the thin one'. Her mother and grandma even have funnier names.</p>
<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a></h3>
<p>Why is the sky blue? And why sometimes a different colour [like it was some days ago here: some weird dark green, then a murky brown, really nice]</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/125974">Use dvdisaster to protect backups on optical media</a></h3>
<p>Recover data from damaged DVD's</p>
<h3><a href="http://wicd.sourceforge.net/">wicd - a simple wireless network manager</a></h3>
<p>Nice alternative for NetworkManager, for example</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/126525">When files disappear, Magic Rescue saves the day</a></h3>
<p>For future reference</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/127055">Using MySQL as a filesystem</a></h3>
<p>Doesn't seem all to useful to me, but maybe fun for a rainy Sunday afternoon</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/126718">Discover the possibilities of the /proc directory</a></h3>
<p>Always wondered what you could do with the /proc directory in Linux? Here's a good starting point</p>
<h3><a href="http://xubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/09/05/howto-run-gimp-in-one-window/">Howto: Run Gimp in one window</a></h3>
<p>There might be better ways, but this is quite a nice trick</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.dialaphone.co.uk/blog/?p=1076">Alienware Android Cell Phone, First Pictures</a></h3>
<p>Surely this can't be serious? It's even uglier than the <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/samsung-matrix/4505-6454_7-20979185.html">Samsung Matrix phone</a>. Or at least almost.</p>
<h3><a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEeePC">DebianEeePC - Debian Eee project</a></h3>
<p>Info on the Debian project to get as much support for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PC">Asus Eee laptop</a> in Debian as possible</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-02/sunflash.20080212.1.xml">Sun Microsystems Announces Agreement to Acquire innotek, Expanding Sun xVM Reach to the Developer Desktop [aka: Sun eats VirtualBox]</a></h3>
<p>Maybe it's just me, but this can't be all for the good</p>
<h3><a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/AdobePhotoshop">Running Adobe Photoshop on wine</a></h3>
<p>Seems to work fine. Another program where you don't need windows for :) [Nor Apple for that matter]</p>
