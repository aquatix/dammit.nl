<p>We just got back from Corfu, and I just got online again after a refreshing period of offlineness. The statistics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Number of digital photographs copied to my laptop from the image tank we had with us on vacation: about 2000</li>
<li>Number of megabytes these take: 6582</li>
<li>Number of pictures I want to set as my new wallpaper: too many to count</li>
<li>9 days of sun, blue skies, blue seas and heavenly warm weather</li>
<li>1 day of rain, thunderstorm</li>
<li>Considerable amount of rain on this side of the plane ride...</li>
<li>Number of unread mails: approx. 326, of which 65 spam, 66 mailinglist digests [with at least 300 emails in them :)] and 11 Morphix mails</li>
<li>414 spam messages caught in my "possibly spam" filter</li>
<li>The amount of time it took my pda to download all these over wifi: about 3 minutes</li>
<li>Number of updates on this Debian sid box: 147 [118 MiB]</li>
<li>Number of days of backlogs of my favourite IRC channels: 11</li>
</ul>

<p>Ah, good to be back again :)</p>
