<p>I just got myself a new laptop^Wbattery. The previous battery of my two year old Acer was down to about an hour of usage on a charge when it suddenly went over to another dimension and refused to provide my trusty workhorse with juice. I ordered a replacement battery, which I got delivered some hours ago and seems to work just fine. Now testing the amount of time I can squeeze out of it :)</p>

<p>It's fun how it feels to have a "new" laptop when you can use it again without having to plug into a power outlet, or not having to do so every hour. /me is happy</p>
