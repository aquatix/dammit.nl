<p>Wow...</p>

<blockquote><p>The banker tapped my account number from my ATM card in, and then printed out a sheet that summarized my details: name, DOB, address, phone numbers, etc. He slid it across the table and asked me to double check that the details were correct. At this point, I could have been any mugger off the street who just withdrew several hundred pounds <em>and</em> had the full details of whoever I mugged. I'm fairly sure I could have closed the account and withdrawn the funds in full, without any security challenges. </p></blockquote>
