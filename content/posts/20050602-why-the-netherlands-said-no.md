<p>I had a list of reasons, but <a href="http://www.alextreme.org/drupal/?q=node/371">alextreme yesterday beat me to it</a>. I'm far from against a united Europe, but I'm not happy with the way things are going now [kinda forced, having a constitution proposed that really isn't one]. Oh, and I'm not against our currency, the Euro, per se, but it baffles me how much prices have raised since the introduction of it. Of course there is such a thing as inflation, but I've seen menu cards -- for example -- where the F as symbol of our guilder had been replaced by a &euro; sign :/</p>
