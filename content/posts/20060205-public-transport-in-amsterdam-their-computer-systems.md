<p>Gotta love public transport running windows...</p>

<p>The contact-less system for checking in/out of the trams and subways. Out of order, as you can read. In French...</p>

<p>The electronical ticket machine, for charging your chip based public transport pass:</p>

<p>Same machine, close up [gotta love their internationalization]:</p>
<div class="content-image"><div><img src="/~mbscholt/images/content/pt_weird_stuff/ticket_machine_out_of_order.jpg" alt="Out of order" title="Out of order" /></div></div>
<br style="clear: both;" />

<p>Same machine, some days earlier [case was opened, computer was visible, as was a standard keyboard. Dialog reads: "Unsave removal of USB device"</p>
<div class="content-image"><div><img src="/~mbscholt/images/content/pt_weird_stuff/unsave_removal.jpg" alt="Unsave removal" title="Unsave removal" /></div></div>
<br style="clear: both;" />

<p>The advertisement system in the new Combino trams [the error dialog was in German...]:</p>
<div class="content-image"><div><img src="/~mbscholt/images/content/pt_weird_stuff/tram_advertising_error.jpg" alt="Tram advertising system error" title="Tram advertising system error" /></div></div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<p>That system is Macromedia Flash based and is manually updated for every screen in the trams. Each tram has about 3 seperate machines [can be noticed when one of these crash ;)]</p>
