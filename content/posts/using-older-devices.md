As a enthusiast for technological things in general, and gadgets in particular, I like to use (and own) shiny devices. Be it a fast (and slightly big) smartphone with the latest OS, or a laptop with a lot of muscle and a 4K (touch)screen, I really can find a use for them :)

However, I'm not a person to throw out older devices so easily. I even have my first cellphone, and most of those from then to my current one. Just recently, I gave away a lot of old motherboards and other perfectly usable, but outdated computer hardware and peripherals to an acquaintance, which will use them again.

Also, devices nowadays are perfectly capable to serve for quite a while. Smartphones tend to age rather a bit (I really hope my Nexus 6P stays with me a bit longer), but laptops and the like from a few years ago are still capable of doing the web browsing, photo editing, word processing and (software) developing that they are bought for.

Lately I had been looking at the newer Kobo e-reader models because of their highres screens and WiFi connectivity (I like that they can sync with [Pocket]()). However, I still enjoy reading books on my Sony PRS-650 that I got at the start of 2011. I even love how it's starting to look nicely beaten up: it's getting used :)

Same goes for the [Acer C720p hacktop](20150407-acer-c720p-chromebook-my-new-hacktop) - er - Chromebook that I got almost three years ago. I use it quite a lot, throw it in my backpack for some quick hacking while traveling by train, and it still runs fine, even for the modest specs it has.
