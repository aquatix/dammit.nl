<p>So today is my 25th birthday. Some stats of this version: I've been online for over ten years now, and running this weblog a year or three. I've had a website for over 8 years, and still have that pre-Microsoft-Hotmail address [yes, Hotmail wasn't from Microsoft back in the days], which I use for MSN IM access with <a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">Gaim</a>. I'm also really busy at the moment with projects for <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/">my university</a> and studying for a reexamination. Deadlines are so damn fun ;)</p>

<p>Anyway, that's why I haven't been posting for a while here also. However, reaching a quarter of a century in uptime is worth an entry ;)</p>
