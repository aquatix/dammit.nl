<p>LOL, in case anybody's interested: I didn't buy the rather expensive [but oh so nice Zaurus], but went for the <a href="http://www.brighthand.com/article/Sony_Clie_TH55_Review">Sony Clie TH55</a> instead [<a href="http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_Story.asp?ID=6604">more pics here</a>]. Add up a <a href="http://www.bargainpda.com/default.asp?newsID=1846&amp;showComments=true">nice keyboard</a> and built-in wifi and bluetooth and I have a new mobile office :) Like I needed a new one =)</p>
<p>That far for spending my birthday money [and that of last year]. Maybe I should do something productive now. Hmz, finally update the design of the <a href="/">AquariuSoft website</a>? Ow, and finish that damn <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> as well. *wanders off*</p>
