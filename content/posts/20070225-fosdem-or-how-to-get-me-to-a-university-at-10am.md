<p>Currently, there's a talk about Suspend to RAM and disk going on. It's quite interesting, but it's not yet helping me getting it to work on my Debian sid laptop :) In a few minutes, a talk on <a href="http://www.opensync.org/">OpenSync</a> is going to start, which is always interesting, considering the amount of gadgets and address lists/calendars I'm keeping around. There are quite some more talks today, but I'm not sure which are really interesting yet. I'll at least try to attend the <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/jabber_jaiku">Jaiku: Jabber the mobile</a> one, which I think will be about the next generation kind of mobile getting-in-touch with your friends [presence in your phone's address book: is she available, shall I IM, email or phone her, etc].</p>

<p>In further news, Brussels [and Belgium in general of course], is a really nice place to get some decent beer into your system. I surely need to attend some beer [tasting] events in the future! But first, when I get home, some sleep I guess ;)</p>
