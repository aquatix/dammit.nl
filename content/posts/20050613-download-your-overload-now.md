<p>It's not yet done [when is a software project done anyways?], not even in 0.1 state as can be seen on the <a href="/page/html/overload/">roadmap</a>, but <a href="/download/html/overload/20050613_snapshot.tar.bz2">here it is</a>, a tarball with the snapshot of today, and a dump of the database tables needed for it.</p>

<p><a href="index.php?rantid=286">My previous posting has a listing of the recent changes</a>, and I want you to remember it's far from final yet. The code may hurt your eyes, but it won't be likely to fsck your pc/server. Be careful tho' ;)</p>

<p>The reason for snapshots is to get feedback on them, so if anybody is interested, please take a look at it, dive into it [if you feel compelled], and please report any bugs/problems/screaming code errors back to me.</p>

<p>OK, I'm back to studying now.</p>
