<p>By the way, did I mention I ordered the Sony Ericsson Z200 I mentioned earlier on? Well, I did last Friday, but I got an e-mail last Tuesday stating the model wasn't in stock, so it was delayed a few days. Is it because I want a rare model [I like the idea, because I don't like walking around with a gadget everybody else has. Don't ask] or is it because it's that wanted? I hope not. We'll see :)</p>
<p>I just want to go online with my Sony Clie palmtop... [it has infrared] =)</p>
