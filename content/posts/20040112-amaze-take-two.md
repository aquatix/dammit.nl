<p>There it is. <a href="/aqs/amaze/">A nice binary windows distribution :)</a>. "Why? That's evil! Binary only!". Er, yeah, but I don't want to release my sourcecode until it's readable without getting a heart attack ;) Besides, I want to wait until the gradings are known so noone can "borrow" some code from me. And I want to figure which license I want to use for releasing. And and and... :)</p>
<p>Well, I guess I'm going to release this work under GPL and going to work on it until it's a nice [addictive?] game. Just for fun. For now, have fun with the windows executable. If you want to have the sourcecode for running it under Linux or something, just contact me.</p>
<p>Map making is encouraged too, and if you find bugs, just send an email to <i>amaze</i> at <i>aquariusoft</i> dot <i>org</i></p>
