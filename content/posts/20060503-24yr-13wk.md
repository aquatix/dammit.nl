<p>Today in #xfce at irc.freenode.net I came across a fairly good description of the upcoming windows version, Vista, which <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060502-6732.html">looks like it is postponed yet another quarter of a year</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p class="quote">longhorn: A big joke from MS, now officially called under it's brand name "Windows Vista", it features WinFS (scrapped), Indigo (backported), Avalon (backported), ngscb (scrapped) and a new shell called monad (scrapped). So, what remains is a nice WinXP theme with a lot of Digital Rights Management crap... Happy vendor-lockin'!</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, it turns out I'm exactly 13 weeks past my 24th birthday. I guess I'll celebrate with some nice cool Belgian beer :)</p>
