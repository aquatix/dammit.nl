<p>Well, that was one cozy, food-overloaded Christmas :). 2nd xmas day was with my girlfriend at her place. Again lots of nice things to eat and nice people to chat with [in real life that is :P]. Saturday was a day to do nothing. Well, to sleep late, watch a recorded episode of <acronym title="Crime Scene Investigation">CSI</acronym>:Miami, work somewhat on the code of this blog and then fiddle around with the settings of <a href="http://www.xfce.org">xfce4</a> on my workstation. Until 2:15AM... Ah well, then slept late again at Sunday, only to find myself in another party untill late that Sunday night. Then had to wake up real early [7:30AM :P] to go to work today. A nice opportunity to write down my life of the past few days :)</p>
<p>Ah, coffee!</p>
