<p>Just finished my second espresso of this morning and pored myself a coke. Still not feeling even slighter awake. I hope I'm not growing resistant against caffeine, otherwise I'd be screwed :) Talking about screwed; I've a talk with my study advisor about my ongoing war with certain classes. Not only that, but it's planned when we've lunch here at work. Damn.</p>

<p>Man, I need another coffee.</p>
