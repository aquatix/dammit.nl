<p>The blogmark updates are a clue about me not being dead, but this weblog has been awefully quiet lately. I have been rather busy and have been microblogging my blurps at <a href="http://twitter.com/michielscholten">my twitterfeed</a>, but that isn't a good excuse to neglect dammIT so badly.</p>

<p>Minor part of the quietness of my online expressions was <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/photos/vacations/southernafrica/">our trip through southern Africa</a>, of which <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/photos/vacations/southernafrica/summary/">I put a photo summary online</a>. Yes, we saw leopards too:</p>

<p>More pictures will appear soonish. Most likely too many for your taste, but damn it was a beautiful trip, full of experiences that are really without a price. In a nutshell: starting off in Cape Town, South Africa, we went north through Namibia, spent some days in Botswana and finished in Zambia, with the magnificent <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/photos/vacations/southernafrica/summary/IMG_9217.jpg/view">Victoria Falls</a> and a lot of other impressive nature.</p>

<p>In other news: today we had an official moment regarding our to-be-built home. The first official moment even, one which everyone had been looking forward a bit for a while yet as there hadn't been any meetings been organised so far, so meeting your future neighbours was still that: something happening in the future.</p>

<p>Well, today we still didn't meet our neighbours, but at least we met some of the people living only a few houses away, which was a pleasant experience. Then we all went outside to witness <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/photos/home/project_w72/legging_grondplaat/">the placement of the first piece of flooring</a>. Also, I took the first picture of our future home:</p>
