<p>I'm building a feedreader -- as you may have noticed -- and am considering using some graphical buttons instead of text links. I'm rather fond of text links, as they are light, clean etc etc, but a good icon can be way more explaining while taking less screen estate.</p>

<p>Anyone having thoughts on this? I consider creating a toolbar of sorts instead of some of the links you can see in <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/various/20050416_1234items_in_overload">the current alpha version of overload</a> [yeah that's windows, but that's all I have got here on my work ;)]. I need to add some functionality still, so the number of links will add up.</p>
