<p>I'm starting to sound as a fulltime web developer/designer right now, but while I was playing with <a href="http://apache.org/">Apache</a>'s <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a> to get cleaner url's, I came along <a href="http://www.julian-bez.de/blog/2004/10/13/why-link-to-indexphp/">Why link to index.php?</a>, which - besides being a nicely designed blue weblog - has some points in favor of this. I'm planning on changing all *.php?param=value url's to something clean like /param/value/ which would be userfriendly and a lot cleaner [and future proof, may I ever come around doing <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>].</p>
<p>It is that I have to study for a midterm for tomorrow, otherwise I was implementing those new url's right now. I'm afraid I even want to break the id's for the postings in my feeds. Hmz, bad idea, but a lot cleaner. Like anybody reads my blog anyway ;)</p>
