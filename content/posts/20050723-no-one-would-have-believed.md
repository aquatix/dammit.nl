<p>Did I mention we went to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407304/">War of the Worlds</a> last Monday? I don't think it was exactly a "wow, cool!" experience, but the movie at least is quite intense and enjoyable. Too bad the very cool soundtrack of the play that was released on vinyl some decades ago wasn't used anywhere [maybe for the better tho']. Not bad.</p>
