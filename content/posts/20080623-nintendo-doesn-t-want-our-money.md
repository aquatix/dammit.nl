<p>Yesterday we went out to buy some stuff (shopping Sundays are rather convenient). We came back with a new pillow for me, which should make sleeping even more fun, but not the two games we wanted.</p>
<p>Of course, those are amongst the most popular at the moment, but you would guess that would mean Nintendo did their best to meet demand? We just want to give you money for Mario Kart and Wii Fitness, now let us dammit!</p>
