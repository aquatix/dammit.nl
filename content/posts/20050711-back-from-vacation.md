<p>It was a short one, and generally a bit too wet one [way does it always rain on me?], but altogether quite relaxing. Catching up on me e-mail and newsfeeds now. Didn't have an internet connection somehow, so I plugged the ADSL modem right in my laptop and now it works :/ Gonna hook up the accesspoint again in a few moments.</p>

<p>I brought my pda and the little wireless keyboard with me, so expect a post with a diary-like description of the events of last week in a few hours. Need to find some free space for my photographs too...</p>
