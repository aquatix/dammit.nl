<p>2009 was a weird year; on the one hand it was quite bland, on the other we did some real cool things, like going on a mind-blowing trip through southern Africa, jumping on the wedding train (the actual fact will take place this new year) and buying a house, amongst others. The paradoxic part is that I both got less and more done than anticipated; just in different fields. All-in-all it was a quite OK year.</p>

<p>This new year will bear us the fruits of our hard labour this year, which will make it a quite fun year for me and my lovely ega. We are going to enjoy the ride and try to have as much fun as possible on the way!</p>

<p>So, a very good, interesting, healthy and just plain enjoyable 2010 to you all!</p>
