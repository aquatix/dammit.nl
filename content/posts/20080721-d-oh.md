<p>Hm, my hate of <acronym title="Internet Service Providers">ISP</acronym>'s has got a slight boost today. I remotely work at my thesis in the vim editor on my home server through <acronym title="Secure Shell">ssh</acronym>, using subversion for version control etc. Currently, I'm at work. My ISP had planned to transfer our account to their new system tomorrow, but decided that today was as good as any, resulting in me sitting at work looking at a disconnected ssh session. Oh well, time for some modelling then.</p>

<p>Also, the weather really sucks, which is not helping my mood to brighten up much. Thankfully I survived a charge of my colleague, with only one of his <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=711">Nerf arrows</a> getting soaked in my coffee. Enough coffee, time for some hot chocolate.</p>
