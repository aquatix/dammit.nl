<p>OK, this must be one of these weeks that things get a life of their own. First, my <a href="/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=252">April Fool's posting</a> <a href="http://www.galaxycow.com/blogs/vermyndax/archive/2005/04/07/2116.aspx">was taken more seriously</a> then intended, the more because of my <a href="/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=253">follow-up</a> and the core of truth in the message. <a href="/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=254">I then continued with a little braindump about my digital life</a> and my wish to spend more time doing "analog" things. That'd be a very nice thing to do, so that's high on my priority list at this moment.</p>

<p>Then, yesterday my server went down.</p>

<p>I suddenly realized how dependend I was on that machine that's tugged away at my parent's place, [not so silently] zooming in their attic. It serves all my mail, hosts my websites, including various web applications I use daily. I make notes on it logged in via <acronym title="secure shell">ssh</acronym>, it serves quite a lot of my files, and so on. And then suddenly I couldn't reach it. I felt lost. That wasn't a nice feeling I can tell you ;)</p>

<p>Anyway, after travelling to Amsterdam and back for classes, I went to my parents place to fix it. Harddisk problems, so I figure I need to backup the quarter of a terrabyte of data on it fast and spend some time looking for other hdd's or cooling them better [placed a casefan besides those three hdd's already now, so they should get some fresh air]. Now I'm keeping my fingers crossed and am looking for a 250GiB hdd to put in an external sled. USB2.0 highspeed or something. That would total up to 150EUR, which is a nice price for such a backup system.</p>

<p>Anyway, about living the digital thing; the living room in our appartment basically is our home office too, <a href="http://www.galaxycow.com/blogs/vermyndax/archive/2005/04/08/2119.aspx">just like Vermyndax's family room</a>. My gf and I are frequently sitting together, each on our own couch [yay :)], laptop on our lap, doing whatever we're doing the time we are online [except that the gf doesn't know where to surf when she's had all the news sites and then just decides to play a game, while I keep surfing and reading and surfing and...]. So, we're definitely living in one room together [which is good, as I was fearing that I'd never leave my own computer/study/office room now I've got one]. And I don't know if it makes any difference whether I'm reading a magazine or surfing the web; if my gf wants some attention, she just crawls next to me on the couch and settles herself against me. That makes doing other things quite impossible ;)</p>

<p>Hm, back to work.</p>

<p>Listening to: 449 tracks shuffled on my Muvo^2. [Eat that, IPod Shuffle :P - hm, shuffling is weird]</p>
