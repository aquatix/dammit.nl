<p>For the third time in a row I'll be attending <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2009/">FOSDEM</a> in Brussels, first weekend of February. I'm looking forward to it because it's a very rich event with a lot of variety, exposing the diversity of the FOSS communities through lots of presentations given by tons of projects. Finally being able to give some IRC friends that beer will be fun too :) (Belgian beer rocks!)</p>
