As some of you might know, GitHub with their GitHubNext team recently released [their own monospace font, Monaspace](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace) in five variants. I was intrigued, because they actually made for an interesting take on the concept, and it was not just one font, but a whole family with each their [own characteristics](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/).

As I was a tad tired of the font family used on dammIT an idea grew, and when [Xe](https://xeiaso.net/) challenged me to do it, I implemented it.

Behold, using all five Monaspace families, from Argon as main body typeface, Krypton for headings, Neon for [codeblocks]({filename}../posts/vim-reloaded.md), Radon for [admonitions]({filename}../posts/admonitions.md) and Xeon for, errr, ah yes, commenting fields!

Another example where it all comes together is [this post on Firefox]({filename}../posts/firefox-deb-ubuntu-2204.md).

Enjoy the mon~~o~~aspaced dammIT HQ.
