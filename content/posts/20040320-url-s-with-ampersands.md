<p>Heh, in a mood to revalidate my xhtml1.1 source against the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3 validator</a>, I came across the Google url I posted recently [about calculating weird stuff]. It contains several ampersands, which I should have converted to the html encoded version, &amp;amp;. Damn XML :)</p>
