<p>Well, anybody interested in screenies of aMaze, my project for <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~graphics/">Computer Graphics</a>, should check out <a href="/images/screenies/amaze/">this screenies page</a>. Now that's the nicest C program I made thus far :)</p>
<p>Yeah, they're kinda large, and my upstream is only 320 kbit/s, so please have some patience ;)</p>
