<p>Well, I'm happy; I installed <a href="/?section=linux&amp;page=aquamorph">aquamorph</a> <a href="/images/screenies/linux/20040616c_galadriel.png">today</a> and with some hassles [aquamorph tools thought they were still dealing with lilo, while the new base uses grub] I now have a <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> sid install here :D On the native resolution of my screen [1400x1050] that is, with help from the Radeon drivers. Yay for Open Source!</p>
<p>Only things to do is get ACPI/APM to work and install the Centrino drivers. Quite related with each other, so I have to figure a way. I hope I don't have to use the proprietary ones.</p>
<p>On the <a href="/?section=linux&amp;page=aquamorph">aquamorph</a> side: I reserved two partitions for testing new installs :) This will make <a href="http://alextreme.org/">alextreme</a> happy ;)</p>
