<p>I read <a href="http://g1powermac.rozica.com/?postid=104">g1powermac's posting about Clusterix</a>, and was of course reminded about my own livecd, <a href="/page/linux/aquamorph/">aquamorph</a>. The project has stalled a bit over the last months, and I want to update it using mmaker [or maybe the nice ibuild, but I like mmaker a bit better because of it's simple xml/command line interface]. However, I don't know if the current base [Morphix 0.5-pre5 "Himalia"] is a stable base to build on, hearing all kinds of stories about Unionfs and the other filesystem overlay systems.</p>

<p>Can anybody give me input on this? [I'm browsing the <a href="http://morphix.org/">morphix.org</a> website and have been receiving the morphix dev mailings about all this].</p>
