This excellent album by [Shirobon](https://shirobon.bandcamp.com/) gave me the energy to finish my day. I woke up with aching shoulders, neck, and upper back, so it was a fun day working at my desk. Listening to these retro-inspired tunes while cooking some dinner wrapped that part of the day up in a good way.
