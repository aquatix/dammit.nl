<p>Just finished implementing the <a href="index.php?page=archive">archive</a> of this blog, tuning the mini navigation thingees and adding a third feed: <a href="blog_comments.rdf">a feed including the comments my one reader makes :)</a>. Was thinking about a way to let users of feed aggregators [like, all sane people] know that a comment was posted, when I came across <a href="http://www.ensight.org/">Ensight</a> of Jeremy C. Wright, which has exact that feature in his feed. So, to good internet practice, I ripped the method and added an extra feed to this blog, because I guessed not everyone is charmed by the constant updates [hm-hmm] of this new feed.</p>
<p>Please try the various pages of this humble site and report bugs at mbscholt at aquariusoft dot org. I've only tested it in Mozilla Firefox under GNU/Linux sofar, so reports of <acronym title="Internet Exploder^WExplorer">IE</acronym> are welcome [guess I've to fire up windows myself one time to see for myself, because everybody is scared of using that flawed program these days, and <a href="index.php?rantid=139">for good reason</a>].</p>
