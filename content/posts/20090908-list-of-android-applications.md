<p>So after a few weeks of loving my <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/hero/overview.html">HTC Hero Android phone</a>, I decided to list the applications I had installed or thought that where just plain handy or nice to have. The result is this
<a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/android/list/">list of cool and handy Android applications</a>. Yes, most I still have installed and in use. I will try to keep the list updated with new finds.</p>

<p>Suggestions for gems I'm missing?</p>

<p>For you wondering why some applications like a Twitter client are missing, I'm rather happy with the tools HTC put in Sense. They actually work decently!</p>
