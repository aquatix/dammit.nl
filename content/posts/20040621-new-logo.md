<p>So I finally made a fitting logo for dammIT. XCalibur is my server, and I thought it was a nice enough picture, but what the hell did it have to do with my blog? So I fired up the Gimp and fiddled around with layers, fonts and drop shadows; low and behold, the new official dammIT logo :)</p>
<p>And yeah, it was some other action of escapism. Now I'm back to studying.</p>
