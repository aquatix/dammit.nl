<p>I <a href="http://am.xs4all.nl/drupal/?q=node/view/171">borrow</a> this word from <a href="http://alextreme.org/">Alextreme</a>, because he cares as much about football as I do: not at all. Of course I think it's too bad we didn't make it as European Champion, but I won't slep less about it. I don't sleep that much anyway.</p>

<p>It's even that bad that when I came home last Wednesday, I finished my dinner and went straight to bed. I slept until my alarmclock went of the next morning - well, not entirely true; I woke at 10PM from a thundering silence. I guess that was the point we had lost the match against Portugal. But when I went to work Thursday I still was slightly sleep deprived and today I'm sitting here after a night of 6 hours of sleep [shouldn't read that much Diskworld books] and have effectively neatralized the sleep of yesterday. I surely am in need of some weekend or vacation :)</p>

<p>PS: I wonder why I want to put a <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> logo along with this post</p>
