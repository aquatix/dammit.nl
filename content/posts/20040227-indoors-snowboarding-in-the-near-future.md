<p>My near future that is: at 3PM I am going to Snowworld with my colleagues and my girlfriend is coming along too. Most of us are going to take lessons [snowboarding is not one of our basic skills :)], and then we are unleashed on the indoor piste. It will be fun :) [If not for us, then for those watching us =)].</p>
<p>Now I hope I can find suitable, warm pants on time :D</p>
