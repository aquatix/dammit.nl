<p>So I'm a big geek. Fact. Everybody knows I love tech; gadgets, hardware software, I grock it all. However, contrary to what you would thing, I don't buy computers that often. I use my four-year-old laptop in a dual monitor set-up as workstation now even. I <em>do</em> buy the occassional gadget, like a decent smartphone, a Sony palmtop, or a Nokia N810 to serve as the successor for that palm. But in the pc/workstation area, I tend to run my hardware in the ground before buying other stuff. My previous workstation was an AMD Duron 750MHz [bought in 2000], until I <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=374">replaced it with a Dual AMD MP2000+ in February 2006</a> [which by then was kinda outdated already too, but still fast because of its dual-processoryness :) ]. Also, my 19" Philips CRT monitor [which still functions fine thankfully] has passed its 6th anniversary too iirc. So I have been thinking about replacing my workstation with a bunch of new hardware.</p>

<p>Let's start with the monitor.</p>

<p>This is the part where I'm going to geek out.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about various set-ups.



<p>Now that's settled, let's continue with the accompanioning hardware
