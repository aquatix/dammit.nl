<p>No, not my own wise words, but I think they are worth reading. First, a piece about top posting [be it in e-mail, newsgroup postings or wherever]:</p>
<blockquote><p class="quote">A: Maybe because some people are too annoyed by top-posting.<br />
Q: Why do I not get an answer to my question(s)?<br />
A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.<br />
Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?</p></blockquote>

<p>For our Dutchies out there I made a translation [so I can be lazy and copy/paste it whenever somebody annoys me with it]:</p>

<blockquote><p class="quote">
A: Misschien omdat sommige mensen zeer ge&iuml;rriteerd raken door top-posting<br />
V: Waarom krijg ik geen antwoord op mijn vraag/vragen?<br />
A: Omdat het de volgorde waarin mensen normaal hun tekst lezen totaal omgooit<br />
V: Waarom is top-posting zo slecht?</p></blockquote>

<p>I want to add to that, that I'm getting annoyed too by people who only answer one of my questions in an e-mail. Maybe they are so accustumed to top-posting [sic], that they're only capable of reading the first paragraph of e-mails or such :/</p>

<p>Anyway, another quote I came along, digging through my quotes.txt file [this one I copied 2004-06-13]:</p>

<blockquote><p class="quote">I got an email with a funny question: A worldwide survey was conducted by the United Nations. The only question asked was: "Would you please give your honest opinion about solutions to the food shortage in the rest of the world?"</p>

<p class="quote">The survey was a huge failure...<br />
In Africa they didn't know what "food" meant.<br />
In Eastern Europe they didn't know what "honest" meant.<br />
In Western Europe they didn't know what "shortage" meant.<br />
In China they didn't know what "opinion" meant.<br />
In the Middle East they didn't know what "solution" meant.<br />
In South America they didn't know what "please" meant.<br />
And in the USA they didn't know what "the rest of the world" meant.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course a bit exaggerated, but some true observations are made. Especially the last one, which is documented in quite some Hollywood movies ;)</p>
