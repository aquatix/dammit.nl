<p>Actually started implementing this box. First "rant": my changelog to this site for this day:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Started implementing my rantbox</li>
	<li>Deleted not-needed pages [some of it's information will be back at the <a href="/">aquariusoft.org website</a>].</li>
	<li>Validated the pagetemplate against the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3 validator</a>, so it seems to be valid xhtml now [instead of html4.0 transitional which the old site was in]</li>
	<li>Removed news related to the old site</li>
	<li>Cleaned up the codebase</li>
	<li>Added an about page</li>
	<li>Added a <acronym title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</acronym></li>
	<li>Added the <a href="related.php">related</a> section for <a href="links.php">interesting links</a> and <a href="howtos.php">HOWTO's</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And yeah, I'm aware the <i>Last Modified</i> box is jumping around the pages. That's because I can't get it to work right [at least not with that crappy <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>...] and am looking for a decent place for it.</p>
