<p>They all have several flaws, as can even be heard in the national news from time to time. Compare them <a href="http://secunia.com/product/11/">here [IE6]</a> [<a href="http://secunia.com/product/11/#advisories_2005">advisories of 2005</a>], <a href="http://secunia.com/product/5134/">here [Netscape 8.x]</a> [<a href="http://secunia.com/product/5134/#advisories_2005">advisories of 2005</a>] and <a href="http://secunia.com/product/4227/">here for Mozilla Firefox</a> [<a href="http://secunia.com/product/4227/#advisories_2005">advisories of 2005</a>]. Look closely. No one is flawless, but Microsoft has a bug in IE6 that's over 2.5 years old. The series of bugs that enables malicious sites to let IE6 download a file encoded in an html file, save it to harddisk [even in your windows dir, overwriting notepad.exe or whatever if you want], and silently execute it, all without showing the user one sign of the activity, safe for the [ever blinking, especially in windows] hdd led on your pc. One hell of a good way to install a trojan horse with keylogging capabilities and whatever modern horses have nowadays. The amount of serious flaws that enables people to get total access to your pc continues to amaze me.</p>

<p>You also see that quite a lot Firefox's vulnerabilies wheren't even that severe, or restricted to a certain situation. Netscape 8.x continues to be a weird piece of software; based on Firefox, but having security flaws the size of IE6's. Ah, wasn't IE6's engine an option to be used in Netscape 8 besides the Gecko one?</p>
