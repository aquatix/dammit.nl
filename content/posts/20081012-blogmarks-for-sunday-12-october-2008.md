<blockquote><p>Of course there <em>is</em> an alternative; a popular computing platform whose design attracts universal admiration. But although we all look forward to literally punching in the numbers, the Wii does not yet quite hack it (use of a dread phrase coming up) 'in the enterprise'.</p></blockquote>

<p>People shouting for ISP's to protect their pc's against spam, virusses and spyware should look at how they protect their property. It's them that expose themselves to a possibly not so friendly world. Better be prepared (and use some decent protection, or decent operating system for that matter).</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.itwire.com/content/view/21016/53/">Microsoft programming contest hacked, defaced</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft followed their annual major Tech-Ed event in Australia with a week-long programming contest called "DevSta," to find "star developers." While the quantity and quality of submissions suggest a poor turnout it certainly caught the attention of at least two hackers who left their mark.</p></blockquote>

<p>With "hackers" stretching the term; it's just a bunch of defacers. Quite funny though :) Interesting that the whole event resulted in a big jawn ("It looks like I wasn’t the only one short on a great idea. The entries so far include not one, but two, calculators. Yawn. Another implements a secure recycle bin but I’m not so sure that really fits in with the competition theme. Others provide an old fashioned green screen terminal client interface for Twitter plus implementations of Pong and Missile Command."). Oh well, at least they <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/10/06/2341255">got some publicity on Slashdot</a>.</p>
