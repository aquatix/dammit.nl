<p>When we're talking geek, I could as well talk about the desktop environment I'm using. I've been using <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a> since their 4.0 version was in early alpha state, and recently beta one of their version 4.4 was released. Now, <a href="http://www.earth.li/~huggie/blog/tech/debian/xfce4.4beta1.html">Xfce 4.4beta1 is being uploaded to Debian sid</a>. So far for Debian lagging behind in versions ;)</p>

<p>For those of you who care about how my desktop looks: <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/albums/various/20060503_xfce4.4b1_overview_01.png">see here for a nice 1600x1200 screenshot with eye candy</a> [<a href="http://aquariusoft.org/albums/various/">more screenshots</a>]. The window in the front with the thumbnails has been made transparent for fun [press Alt and scroll on the titlebar, yay]. FYI [and my own future reference]: the GTK2 theme is <a href="http://insystemx.blogspot.com/2006/02/gtk2-bevox-042006.html">Bevox</a>, icon theme is <a href="http://www.dsslive.org/xfce/Tango-xfce.tar.gz">Tango with some Xfce additions</a>, and the window decorations are Xfce 4.4's default. The wallpaper I shot myself [closeup of a tulip], and composition is enabled; window decorations have a slight transparency too [enabled those myself in the WM's compositor settings]. Eat that, far-from-released Vista ;)</p>

<p>Ooh, almost time...</p>
