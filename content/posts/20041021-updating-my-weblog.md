<p>I mentioned <a href="index.html?">earlier</a> that I was thinking about merging the software of this weblog into <a href="/?section=html&amp;page=aqute">aqute</a>, but I'm currently updating and extending it seperately. I don't have that much time currently and probably won't have it in the upcoming months either, so I'll just implement some features I want badly [well, which are kinda handy] and tweak the interface. It's coming along nicely, so be prepared for some nice updates :)</p>
<p>One of the major features I want implemented is the ability to receive an e-mail when someone reacted on a post you reacted to already. Of course this will be optional [just check the box along with filling in your address]. Besides that, I want that Edit post/blogmark functionality implemented once and for all :D</p>
