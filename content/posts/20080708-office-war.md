<p>Yesterday I ordered a <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/v/photographs/random_pics/nerf_maverick.html">Nerf Maverick</a> from eBay along with some extra arrows. These toy guns shooting soft plastic arrows are quite cool and great for performing an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVKnF26qFFM">office war</a> [YouTube]. I wanted to keep  my arsenal civilised, as otherwise I might have gone overboard and got myself a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/animakitty/2198911894/">Nerf Recon CS-6</a>, a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/animakitty/2295046319/in/set-72157600222350486/">Nerf Vulcan</a> automatic gun [I have a great spot between some monitors], or just this <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/animakitty/2126244867/in/set-72157600222350486/">neat steampunk modded Maverick</a>.</p>

<p>Also noteworthy are <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/v/photographs/random_pics/AirshipCaptain2.html">this awesome mod of the Nerf Firefly I found on eBay</a> [a bit too expensive to buy though at $73.15]. There are also nice metal-painted ones and modified versions that shoot farther and faster. Big fun to annoy friends and/or coworkers with ;)</p>
