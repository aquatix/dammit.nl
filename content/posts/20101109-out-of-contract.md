<p>My third temporary contract will run out at the end of December, and because this company is currently in the middle of a reorganisation, they don't take on people on a contract for undetermined time.</p>

<p>That means I'm in the running for a new job currently! It's really too bad as I was quite enjoying myself here; great colleagues, interesting work, windy working environment (next to the sea). Well, windy isn't that great, but at least there's always something to watch from the window when I need to think some things over. Still, everything has an ending...</p>

<p>Of course I'm already looking and asking around, but if someone is interested in hiring a Computer Science MSc, please feel free to contact me :)</p>

<p>Update 11:58: <a href="http://dammit.nl/files/cv_nl.pdf">here's my Curriculum Vitae</a> (Dutch)</p>
