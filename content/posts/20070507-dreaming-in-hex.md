<p>I had the strangest dream last night. I dreamt that the world became a bit better, and a bit more fun to live in; that gave me a fuzzy feeling of course, but when I tried communicating with people on my computer, all messages where "09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0". Really weird... I almost heard some big corporations screaming in pain.</p.
