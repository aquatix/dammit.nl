<p>Or at least I hope it's going to be. Finishing off some loose ends of a project I'm doing, which is going to be tested later this day. Oh rejoice :) It's quite stressfull tho', and my hands and shoulders hurt. Bleh.</p>

<p>I'm really enjoying watching the sun coming up in our apartment. It's just such a nice view through the trees and [currently] over the frozen landscape. /me is happy with his view ;)</p>

<p>Classes started again, but I've been busy with this project. Not sure if I'm going to do the re-examination this evening too... Stupid maths. Thankfully some interesting courses are intermingled with the boring ones.</p>
