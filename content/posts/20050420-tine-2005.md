<p>I went to <acronym title="The ICT Networking Event">TINE</acronym> 2005 today. This is an event for ICT professionals, where you can ogle at huge server racks, backup systems, nice Apple hardware, boothbabes and lots of goodies. It was quite fun, chatted a bit with all those buzz-fuzz dudes and saw a few nice things.</p>

<p>An impression:</p>

<p>And then there was a presentation about IT in the Formula 1 etc with Allard Kalff [a well-known Dutch driver/tv host]:</p>
