<p>Apparently I survived <a href="http://fosdem.org/2008/">FOSDEM 2008</a>, and I've put <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/v/photographs/trips/fosdem_2008/">some pictures online to be my witness</a>. I'm in none of them, but my fellow geeks are :) I should have made some more pictures of the hotel we where staying in, as it was a lot better than the hotel of previous year; the quality was a lot better, and it had a nice view from the restaurant, and quite a nice foyer. Oh well, at least you can get an impression of the room I shared with <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/v/photographs/trips/fosdem_2008/IMG_2576.jpg.html">Gertjan</a>.</p>

<p>If anyone wants the original sized version of some photo, mail me. Also, some pics are a tad dark, but I have the raw versions, so I can lighten them up [quite] a bit.</p>

<p>After the last talk on Sunday, we went for Brussels Central Station and had to hurry to get some food [Belgian frites :)]; I had to hurry even more, as I needed a ticket from Brussels Central to the Dutch border, and we only had 20 minutes to do both. When I finally came hurrying to the platform with two backpacks, food in one hand, ticket in another, I was told that the train was twenty minutes late. Oh well, we could at least eat our food in peace that way ;)</p>
