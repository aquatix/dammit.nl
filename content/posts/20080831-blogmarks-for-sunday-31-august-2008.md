<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>

<p>This actually looks like I game I'd want to play: engaging puzzles, pretty graphics, no condescending (dumbed-down) user interface/help/tutorials. You have to figure it out on your own, and <a href="http://www.perceptionroll.com/2008/08/perception-roll-review-braid.html">that seems to work pretty well, according to this review</a>. Too bad it's currently only out for XBox live, but a PC version is planned.</p>
