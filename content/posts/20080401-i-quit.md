<p>I've had it. I'm done with being a student and following courses, doing practicals and projects. Maybe it's because it's all a mess in my head and I don't get any rest, being it in the evening or in weekends. I just want my 9-5 job and free weekends :)</p>

<p>So, from now on, I'm no longer student. Work is not going to like it, but whatever. Screw university, I'm a salary slave now!</p>
