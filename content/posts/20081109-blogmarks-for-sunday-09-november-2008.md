<p>Kay's vision, which he dubbed the "Dynabook," was for a 2-pound, 1-Mpixel color computing device.</p>
<blockquote><p>"...the Dynabook was never built. But it greatly inspired the devices we now call laptops, although it's taken four decades to slim the tech down to the point where usable computers actually weigh as little as two pounds. To honor his achievements, Mountain View's Computer History Museum on Wednesday will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the legendary Dynabook. [Quoting Kay:] 'The Amazon Kindle is kind of a subset of a Dynabook â€” too much of a subset. The screen is too small, it is not very capable of dynamics, the keyboard is poor, etc. But it does have several limited service ideas that are good. The next version of a Kindle could be really exciting.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>There are some interesting thoughts on interfaces in the article. Current devices and applications like web browsers could be improved a lot in terms of integration and workflow.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.brighthand.com/default.asp?newsID=14380">Reading Shouldn't Require an Interface</a></h3>
<p>Fullscreen fbreader in portrait mode with black background and white font works great for me; just the reading interface, music might be played completely in te background and the +/- buttons are perfectly placed for page up/down. Automatic scrolling is an option too of course, but I don't like that much.</p>

<p>Hm, interesting. Of course it's dependent of your tastes, but some whisky's shouldn't be watered obviously.</p>
