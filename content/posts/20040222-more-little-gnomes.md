<p>BTW, I've put up <a href="/images/screenies/linux/20040222b_amd1200_gnome.png">a little screenie</a> of me browsing my own blog at my own user at the gnome install. I created my own user so I can mess around with Gnome without getting my dad angry [he likes the default <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a> theme]. So linux is running quite fine at his pc, aside from the glitch that the network connection only works when you reconfigure it [or do a ifconfig eth0 &lt;ip address&gt; etc] and the nvidia driver imploding the X session. Ah well, made a little script to set up the network, and his machine runs fine with the default vesa video driver =)</p>
<p>I'm off listening some Infected Mushroom. Quite some interesting music you can discover when you've got interesting colleagues :)</p>
