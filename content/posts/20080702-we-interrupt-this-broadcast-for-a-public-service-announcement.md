<p>Ten years ago I was sixteen years old, an uncertain, geeky teenager. Right this moment we where on a school trip in Paris, that nice, big city in France you might have heard of. Earlier on a few girls of my class had tried to set up things, but I decided to do it my way. On the Thursday evening boat trip over the Seine, I managed to get a place next to that cute girl I knew. We watched the city glide by together, pointing out places where our little group had walked that week and weird statues we noted. When I put my hand on her leg, she didn't remove it or complain. When we left the boat, we walked hand in hand.</p>

<p>It's been ten years I've been together with this wonderful girl who has grown from an (also bit geeky) teenage girl with awesome long hair to a professional pharmacist who still for some weird reason seems to love me. It's also been <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=357">two and a half years that we 'engaged', or rather made our relation more official</a>. I won't comment on the 'and when is the wedding' questions yet ;)</p>

<p>The last decade has been fun, both of us growing from teenagers going to high school, going through university and ultimately landing a nice job, with me being proud of my girl being head pharmacist of her own pharmacy (even though she doesn't own it; hey, no burdens, only benefits :) ). I love you sweetie, let's multiply that decade by a large amount.</p>
