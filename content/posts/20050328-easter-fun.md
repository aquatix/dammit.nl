<p>Sitting here with my laptop on my lap on the couch, digesting the food I enjoyed myself with this Easter I cannot help but feeling myself a bit uneasy. [Heh, "Easy like Sunday morning" on the radio right now]. I'm studying for three exams I have to do tomorrow and Wednesday, and programming some at my new webbased Overload Feedreader, which I will make public somewhere later this week. Friday I'll have a meeting about the big project I've been doing [and which still has to be finished]. So, it's a busy and quite stressful week, while all I really want to do today is reading a bit in the second book of the <a href="http://www.tor.com/jordan/">Wheel of Time series</a> and finishing that online feedreader I've made in <a href="http://www.php.org/">PHP</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>. Ah, and having that dinner this evening at my parents place.</p>
