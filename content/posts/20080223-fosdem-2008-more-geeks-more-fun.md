<p>I'm currently ending my first day at <a href="http://fosdem.org/2008/">FOSDEM 2008</a> in the Lightning talks room, listening to a presentation on <a href="http://bongo-project.org/">Bongo Project</a>. It's been fun; after the excellent <a href="http://fosdem.org/2008/beerevent">Beer Event</a> last night [got sliiightly drunk on the great Belgian beers] we got a nice day with a variety of talks [I followed talks on the game Battle for Wesnoth, X.org drivers for ATi and nVidia and a lot more. It's getting time for food now :)</p>
