<p>Did you know...</p>
<p>...dammIT--this weblog--has turned one year old today? Lots of things have changed in that year, a lot has stayed the same. Same shit, different day.</p>
<p>...Xfce 4.2 [RC2 and companions] is cool? I've just installed it on my trusty old AMD Duron 750MHz workstation and it's spinning like a happy cat. Well, Sade is on beep-media-player, but Xfce 4.2 is doing the graphics :) Screenies will be up in the Near Future(tm)</p>
