<p>Today I went to my university for a talk about a practical I'm working on [some program that has multiple computers in a cluster calculate on a certain problem], and which I've been pulling my hairs out over, as it wouldn't stop deadlocking and doing other wondrously erratic things. The joy of voodoo programming ;)</p>

<p>The weather is quite nice [however, it starts to get really cloudy now]: sun was shining, wind was quite forceful, and I took a walk when our metro refused to continue working while standing at the station before my planned transfer point. It was really nice to walk through the windy outside, sun on my face, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shpongle">Shpongle</a> on my ears and maneuvering through the crowds towards my university department's building. I should take a walk more often.</p>

<p>Now back to rewriting a java class from scratch :)</p>
