After a rather pleasant flight on Sunday morning, where out of 80 passengers, I sat next to the only other EuroPython visitor, I took a nicely airconditioned train from Bologna to Rimini. I really hoped that airco was everywhere, otherwise the 33C would seriously hamper my capability of even remembering what was said just five minutes ago.

Moving on to Monday, I was thankfully doing just fine.
