<p>Lately I've seen myself following a trend of putting more and more work in online tools. I've had an online linkdump for ages now, but since <a href="http://www.sitebar.org/">Sitebar</a> integrated in Firefox it's serious. Furthermore, I switched from various standalone <acronym title="RDF Site Summary">RSS</acronym> aggregators to <a href="http://www.bloglines.org/">Bloglines</a>, a free online service.</p>
<p>Besides these two key services, I've got a <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">GMail</a> account [still gladly using my own mailserver besides], an <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut</a> account [OK, I'm not seriously using that one], I use a small script written by myself to read some mailings online, I'm designing various CMS'es for my sites [this blog, my <a href="/">aquariusoft.org</a> site] and I'm using various other ones [like the one on <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">morphix.org</a>.</p>
<p>In other words: my world is centered around my browser. I'm using a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">good and stable one</a>, thank $DEITY, equipped with <a href="http://nexgenmedia.net/extensions/">various</a> <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/about/notifier#moz">extensions</a>, including some <a href="http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&amp;id=10&amp;vid=215">for my peace of mind</a>. But it remains only one program. If it crashes, I seriously loose work, for various things. Of course it's nice to have your environment with you whereever you go/work [that's exactly the reason it's happening this way for me], but it's interesting to watch the convergence.</p>

<p>I realized I missed some services. These replace actual hardcopy items for me, so they fall in a slightly different category, but here they are: <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">wikipedia</a> - an awsome online encyclopedia, <a href="http://dictionary.com/">dictionary.com</a> - a handy online English dictionary and <a href="http://www.acronymfinder.com/">acronymfinder</a> - nice to have in the world of abbreviations</p>
<p>Online manuals [<a href="http://www.php.net/docs.php">PHP</a>, <a href="http://diveintopython.org/">Python</a>, <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/">MySQL</a>] are a great source of information for me too, as is the <a href="http://www.imdb.com">Internet Movie Database [IMDB]</a></p>
