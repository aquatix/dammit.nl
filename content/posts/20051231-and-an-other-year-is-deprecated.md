<p>I'm spending the last hours of 2005 at the place of my GFs mother, where everyone is gathering to eat some of the home-made "oliebollen" [you know, those fried weat balls with raisins and such ;)].</p>

<p>2005 was another year that rushed by. Lots of things I wanted to do only went half done, others I didn't anticipate did. It was our first year living on our own, which is rather fun [indeed, going back to live with my parents would suck majorly, how much I like them]. I didn't really have resolutions, so that's a plus, as all of them have been reached ;) Resolutions for 2006 are being thought of, more about that later.</p>

<p>So, food is no issue here, and the mood is starting to rise. I think it's time for wishing everybody a really nice upgrade to 2006 and a great time! Till next year!</p>
