<p>OK, after being exposed to windows for four days at stretch last week at work, I came along a cool application to make working with only one desktop a bit worthwhile: <a href="http://www.entbloess.com">Entbloess</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/">Expose</a> for windows. This will show smaller versions of your current open windows, so you can tab through them, or just point and click them. Then that window will expand again and be the current active window. Really cool :)</p>

<p>Anybody knows whether a good implementation exists for *nix? I've looked around, but only noticed <a href="http://www.pycage.de/software_expocity.html">Expocity</a>, which is for Gnome's Metacity and a tad slow if I read reviews right. Pointers?</p>
