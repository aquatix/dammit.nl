<p>We went to <a href="http://www.toomler.nl/">Toomler</a> Friday the 8th to see some Comedy Train [5 funny stand-up comedians]. But we really where there to listen some <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Deelder">Jules Deelder</a> [Dutch Wikipedia link; let's just say he's a very interesting artist, nicknamed the Nighttime Major of Rotterdam - which is another major city here in the Netherlands]. Well, listening ain't really a good way of describing it; it's more enjoying the sight of him performing some really great jazz and bluez together with Trio Me Reet [Dutch for "my ass"], and of course being engulfed in that soundscape.</p>

<p>A small impression:</p>

<p>The image quality sucks, but that's because I shot them with my camera phone.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday we had a company party, which brought us to Club Panama in Amsterdam to toy around a bit and eat some, then continued at the Convention Factory some [very rainy] minutes down the street. You may know the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Man_Group">Blue Man Group</a>. Well, we know them for sure now! What a brilliant show they've got. The three guys never say a word, but their act is filled with humour [by means of light texts, multimedia presentations and on-stage acts with people from the public. Also the way they use their [sometimes oddly inventively] instruments is just intriguing.</p>

<p>Of course we had to catch them on the photosensitive chip:</p>
