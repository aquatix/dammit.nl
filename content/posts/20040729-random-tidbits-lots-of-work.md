<p>In other news: after I uploaded aquamorph while working, a got to work quite late and only updated the pages here at <a href="/">aquariusoft.org</a> at some point after midnight. I added a <a href="/?section=linux&amp;page=aquamorph_todo">todo page</a> too, which will become quite important for the project in the future :) Soon I'll post some new screenshots and add a changelog page, including a nice overview of the important parts of aquamorph. I'll put that in a Specs page I guess and post the changes in a "done" box at the todo page or something. What am I rambling here? I should just go and add those pages. Well, no, first some sleep. Me weak, me tired. Well, then some sleep for me as reward for some days of hard work.</p>
