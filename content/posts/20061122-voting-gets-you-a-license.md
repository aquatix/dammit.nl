<p>So, non-voters - if you're out there - be aware you just missed out on your license to whine about the politics, the system, the country, it's quirky inhabitants and just things in general :)</p>

<p>People who don't vote out of protest or just can't bring up the energy, just be aware that you lost your right to bitch on the system. I know that none of the parties where perfect [none was even close to a match for me], but at least get your preferences known, so we don't get a shitty government because of distortion [there are always people who *do* vote, and they may not share your views].</p>
