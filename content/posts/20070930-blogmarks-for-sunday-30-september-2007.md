<p>Personally, I only hear people bickering on it; "I can't do *anything* useful on it" was one remark I heard even today. Someone else had to dig deep to get to the "Run..." option. Alt+F2 is all I say ;)</p>

<p>Finally a good WTF again; it's about those annoying "secret questions" websites [and even online banks] use for verifying your identity. It's not like someone who has researched you a bit can do a really good guess, but also it's hard to remember the exact answer you gave. The email those guys received is just priceless and adds it all up:</p>

<blockquote><pre>Dear -------.com,

Extra security, fine. I don&rsquo;t mind it. But let&rsquo;s get serious.

I never met my grandfather (he&rsquo;s been dead over sixty years). My parents 
never talk about where they were born. I was never married. I didn&rsquo;t go to 
college. High school mascot? Come on, I&rsquo;ve been out of high school for decades! 
And who has a favorite color?

Sure, I can make up answers, but since there&rsquo;s no way I'll remember my made up 
answers, then I&rsquo;m screwed. So I&rsquo;ll have to write them all down, but that doesn&rsquo;t
seem very secure. So, basically, I&rsquo;m screwed.

Thank you,
---- ----------------</pre></blockquote>
