<p>Mind the parts where it states that it "reserves the right at all times to remove or refuse to distribute any content on the Service, such as content which violates the terms of this Agreement. Google also reserves the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary". I guess other providers do the same, but I'm still glad I'm my own provider concerning email traffic.</p>

<p>Heh, talking about GMail; Slashdot now <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/21/1150236&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=217&amp;tid=95">has an article about Hotmail blocking GMail messages</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p class="quote">"Emails and invitations sent to Hotmail from Gmail accounts do not bounce, but nor do they arrive in the recipient's Inbox - they vanish mysteriously into the aether."</p></blockquote>
<p>The autor hasn't been able to verify this but it's interesting nonetheless.</p>
