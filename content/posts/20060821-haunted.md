<p>Am I cursed? I have the very annoying "habit" to have projects and unfinished courses haunting me. Cleaning my slate hasn't succeeded as yet. Maybe I should be a bit less overzealous on the project side and actually wrap up some of the exiting projects I embarked on and finishing that study?</p>

<p>Just wondering.</p>
