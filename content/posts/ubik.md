Normally I don't write book reviews, because I do not have much to add to the thousands of reviews already out there, and would rather spend my time in the next book than typing words about what I just read.

Still.

Recently I finally was able to [break my dry spell of reading]({filename}../posts/reading-challenge-start.md) and enjoyed a collection of books that have some themes in common yet are very different in scope and while what I write about them here could barely be called 'reviews', I want to give them all a mention as I enjoyed reading them very much, they provided me some fascinating food for thought, and they might be of interesting for your reading list.

## Ubik

First, I was able to cross [Ubik](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34207748-ubik) by Philip K. Dick of my to-read list, something I have been wanting to do for years. I was not certain what to expect of it, but it positively surprised me - especially considering how long ago it was written.

There are some pieces that both have not aged that well and are integral part of the story, like everyone smoking cigarettes and the use of coins everywhere. The latter is pretty fun - in a cringe way - as they really portray the micro-payment situation we increasingly find ourselves in, culminating in a TV taking payment to even turn on and the door of someones apartment refusing to open to let them out because they cannot pay the $0.10 coin it is asking for that task.

Reading a bit around those analog relics (someone even laments their collection of high-end vinyl and tapes, which could be retro-chique nowadays), Ubik is an interesting and fun thought experiment about what could happen when dream-like worlds for almost-dead people mingle with the 'real' world, which has to deal with telepaths being an integral part of society, and anti-psis working from agencies to counter the effects of those mind-readers.

## Eversion

What a ride [this book by Alastair Reynolds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58727132-eversion) was. I do not want to say too much here as I don't want to give away clues, but this Groundhog Day meets Cthulhu story is such a fun and fresh adventure with some hidden depths.

## Murderbot

Next I plunged straight into Martha Wells' [The Murderbot Diaries](https://www.goodreads.com/series/191900-the-murderbot-diaries) serie, attracted by the small book size (100 page-ish) and quirky premise. Let me say, Murderbot is now my favourite human/machine construct. Angsty as heck, relatable more often than comfortably admitted and with some observations about human affairs and social interactions that look from that slightly different angle that make you ponder them.

'Murderbot' is the secret name of the SecUnit you ride the head of in these (as of now) seven books and which has to come to grips becoming their own person instead of the robot-like half-machine-half-biology that they were designed to be, not even counting having to deal with such a thing as 'friends', be it in the form of (former) clients, or a sentient transport ship.

## Discworld

Does this wonderful series of books by Terry Pratchett need any introduction? I hope not, but if [it does](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld), you're in for a treat. 

Two very different books were read, starting with Commander Vimes of the City Watch in [Night Watch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47989.Night_Watch). Traveling back in time by some freak weather, he has to deal with the civil uprising he was part of as young watchman, find the stabby

## The Hydrogen Sonata (last of the Culture series)

With a sad feeling I've started reading this [tenth instalment and last book in the Culture series]](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13497991-the-hydrogen-sonata) by Iain M. Banks. Sad because there are no more of those wonderful books.

Murderbot might have made friends with a sentient ship in their voyage to finding theirselves, the Culture ships are a different breed altogether. Vastly complex, smart, vein and occassionally funny, they are their own people and provide an interesting counterpoint to the (generally really not so baseline) human(oid) beings living
