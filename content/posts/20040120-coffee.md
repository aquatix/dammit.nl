<p>Coffee: the liquid to rule them all. Besides beer. Oh, and Wodka and Red Bull [both pure, thank you]. But coffee is a nice way to kinda wake up. Without it, my world would be a bigger mess then it already is.</p>
<p>Speaking 'bout messes: I sincerely hope not, but it could be I messed up my fourth exam in a row this year. ... And my software for the computer networks project doesn't work [tcp stack is giving weird errors, while the http daemon kinda works. But not quite. Ah well...].</p>

<p>Something more funny: <a href="http://boingboing.net/2004_01_01_archive.html#107450706581249394">a nice "adverticement" for Starbucks' coffee</a>. When I was at it ;) Oh, and a <a href="http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_np=0&u_pg=1636&u_sid=979879">weird story</a>. And some <a href="http://www.cowlesgallery.com/Burtynsky.html">food for thought</a>.</p>
<p>But I've got work to do. That's a nice forget-your-study-thing too. bbl :)</p>
