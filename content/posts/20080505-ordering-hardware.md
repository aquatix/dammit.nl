<p>So I ordered some new hardware parts for building a decent workstation a while ago. Today I received the first batch: two 750GB sata hdd's, making a nice grand total of 1.5TB :)</p>

<p>However, I also received an email stating that the processor I ordered - a Intel core2duo E8400 3GHz one - is in the backorder and expected the 2nd of June. I heard Intel has difficulties shipping it, but this is a set back :( It will likely leave me with an almost complete pc for over two weeks. Oh well, patience is a virtue...</p>
