<p>So it seems to be summer now. Not that I think this drizzly weather is worth that stamp, but at least it's official. So, weather gods: where is our summer???</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.manuzhai.nl/">Manuzhai</a>, who had <a href="http://www.manuzhai.nl/weblog/comments/gmail/">some invitations to give away</a>, I now have a <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">GMail</a> <a href="/images/screenies/sites/20040621_gmail_01.png">account</a> to play with! Thanks! Not that I needed 1GB of storage [I run my own server :P ], but it's fun thinkering with this account. It's kinda slow though... It <a href="/images/screenies/sites/20040621_gmail_02.png">doesn't quite work too yet</a>. Hm well, maybe I should restart my browser or something? Why does this remind me of windows services...</p>
