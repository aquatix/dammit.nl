<p>Some friend of mine - rest assured, I won't mention your name <a href="http://www.20six.nl/Roos">Hedda</a> - told some nice stories about her Jane [search her blog for more info, for those with minds dirty enough ;)] instead of programming nicely at her Computer Networks Assignment with her practicum partner. Had lots of fun trying to explain, but hearing those stories instead :)</p>

<p>Anyways, presentation went OK. I was nervous as hell - as usual - so my voice was rather monotone, which was a shame, according to the teacher, because he quite liked the subject. That kinda made my day ;)</p>

<p>Fsck, should go to home now to get some food =)</p>
