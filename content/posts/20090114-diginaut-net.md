<p>I have been looking for a new domain which would work in parallel with aquariusoft.org. People tend to stumble a bit on that domain's name when getting my email address or url, so I wanted something more fool proof (cue Universe inventing a better fool).</p>

<p>Anyway, today in my drive to work I came up with something I hadn't tried yet, and behold, one variation worked and I think it's rather suiting even. Behold: <a href="http://diginaut.net">diginaut.net</a>. Yes, it might be a bit cheesy (hell, the current design sure is - beware my three-minute inkscape hack-up!), but it describes me: navigating the vast oceans of digital information, doing fun stuff with it. The .net domain of course is about the connected part.</p>

<p>I'm not sure yet what to do with the domain apart from finally having a proper one for my email addresses, but I think I'll figure out something. Suggestions are welcome :)</p>

<p>Now for some sleep.</p>
