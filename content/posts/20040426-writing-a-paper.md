<p>What is it about me and writing papers? Well, papers about subjects I don't really, _really_ care about? I just don't get them done. Well, this one doesn't have to be lengthy, so I'm going to act tomorrow like it has to be submitted that evening. Guess I'll be finished by 2PM. Hm yeah, that leaves me plenty of time for other things. Then I guess I should go now and sleep somewhat. 'night all :)</p>
