<p>Today my girlfriend and I are together for six years; that's more than a quarter of our lifes. That's kind of scary, but also a lot of fun :)</p>
<p>&lt;plug&gt;Maybe someone in Amsterdam or surroundings knows an appartment or something which we can live in and still be able to actually buy food and stuff? Would be a nice gift ;)&lt;/plug&gt;</p>
