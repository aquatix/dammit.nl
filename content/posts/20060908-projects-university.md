<p>So I finally <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=459">released aquamorph v0.4</a> [which is available from sourceforge.net now, so feel free to download and try it!]. I reduced my projects to a minimum [I'm even using Liferea as my primary newsfeed reader now instead of overload :/], so I have time for classes and such. Sounds good to go, and now I only need to motivate me more for doing the non-classes university stuff [Bachelor project comes to mind]. *You can do it! Tjakka!* [Sorry, reference to some Dutch motivation guru ;)].</p>
