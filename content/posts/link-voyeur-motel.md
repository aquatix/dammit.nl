Gerald Foos bought a motel in order to watch his guests having sex. He saw a lot more than that.

Fascinating story, lots of (un?)expected things happening, and the author having to consider multiple times whether to intervene, contrary to his long-standing agreement with the owner.

(Might need some hoops to jumo through to read the article, I have it in Pocket).
