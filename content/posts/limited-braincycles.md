Do you know that feeling that halfway through the day you start to be less 'fresh'? Myself, I have the experience of getting a bit slower over the course of the day: in the morning, I can fix the problem I was struggling with the last afternoon in a few minutes, but after lunch, problems seem to get a bit harder to solve.

I call it having a finite amount of braincycles, but really it's 'just' biology. Research showed that [your brain gets smaller throughout the day](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2015/06/08/brain-bigger-in-the-morning/) and it gets polluted by waste materials and toxins that [get cleared away when you rest and sleep](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-sleep-clears-brain); apart from that, it's also [because of the way our sleep cyclusses work](https://sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need).

These processes mean that during the day, your focus gradually decreases. It makes morning the best time to do work that needs inspiration, imagination and creativity. Meetings then are generally better done in the afternoon.

Also, giving your head a rest by not staring at your smartphone, but out of the window of your train.
