<p>Well, it seems about every oddity in this football competition thingee of the last few weeks has come reality: someone just told me Greece has won. Like I predicted :P Funny, because all major players where kicked quite early in the process and now the home playing party has been kicked by their opponents. I guess a lot of people are owning a very small subset of people a lot of money considering those football pools :D</p>
