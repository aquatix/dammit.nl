<p>Well, duties are calling. I have to finish a project for <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~graphics/">Computer Graphics</a> before next Friday [I've quite some nice ideas, but they have to crystalize into usable code yet...]. Tomorrow there's my regular job too, so that's another day I can't work at the project. Ah well, I should blame myself: had planned to work at it 3 weeks in December. And here I am, implementing it in 3.5 days :)</p>
<p>Need some pills to work through the nights ;)</p>
