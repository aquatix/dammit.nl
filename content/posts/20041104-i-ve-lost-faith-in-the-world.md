<p><a href="http://www.alextreme.org/drupal/?q=node/view/279">Alex describes exactly how I felt yesterday</a> [and still feel now]. I couldn't have said it better. Problem with "America voted for another 4 years, then they deserve him for another 4 years" is that we have to suffer it for another 4 years too... As to speak with <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/">the Votemaster</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p class="quote">Well, it's all over. The people have spoken. Winston Churchill once said: "In a Democracy, people get the kind of government they deserve." So be it.</p></blockquote>

<p>That was a lousy way to wake up yesterday. And before that, the <a href="index.php?rantid=200">tragic murder on Theo van Gogh</a>. And yesterday evening a more personal bad news phonecall [more on that later]. Life officially sucks.</p>
