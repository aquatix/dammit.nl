<p>Exam time! Four of them in under two weeks. In the meanwhile a homework assignment, some classes with at the end of the month June a fifth exam. Keeps you out of the pub ;)</p>

<p>And, of course, it's time to play around a bit with things you intended to do a long while but never came around to. So, I've imported quite some of my projects into <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SVN</a>, finally started a serieos <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/html/overload/">Python/Django project</a> and updated my <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/">main website</a> [check for example the <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/portfolio/">portfolio</a>]. OK, time for my first exam.</p>
