<p>I fiddled around a bit with bluetooth on my laptop, getting the network link working again for my bluetooth enabled Sony Clie TH55. I managed to get network synchronizing working too, so now I'm able to synchronize with my GNU/Linux installation completely wireless. <a href="/?section=palm&amp;page=bluetooth_linux">Read here how to setup bluetooth for Palm on Linux</a>. Feedback is welcome :)</p>
<p>Hm, bluetooth is nice, but synchronizing 32MB of data through it is not. It's synching for over an hour now! Maybe I should buy that wifi accesspoint so I can do a network synch over 802.11b. A new howto-page will follow when I get my hands on one.</p>
