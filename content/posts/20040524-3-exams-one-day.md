<p>A quick blurp in between some "serious" studying for three exams I have this week [one tomorrow, two on Wednesday]. Last weekend wasn't as productive as I hoped it was [computers sooo distract while reading slides from them and I'm sooo weak], so here I am trying to read as much useful stuff as possible, trying to comprehend the previous exams.</p>
<p>So it's not that I'm dead, but it's close.</p>
<p>Aw, and why is it so sunny outside...</p>

<p>Did I mention I really should clean my room? Damn, if I even mention that, how's that for escapism...</p>
