<p>Life is just being life, with it's endless stream of classes, days of work and projects to work on. Family to visit, parties to celebrate [housewarming party was great!] and nights to sleep^W hack on my websites and other things. So, I've not been posting that much, but life is more interesting than it appears to be. For example all those calculus and lambda calculus classes, where I sometimes wonder where the hell they are talking about and sometimes start jawning and wondering why I failed them the previous year. Nah, that's not interesting, that's default.</p>

<p>I'm starting to look forward to the movie release of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0371724/">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>. <a href="/~mbscholt/blogmarks.php?year=2005&amp;month=03#url358">The trailer</a> is online already. I just hope it will live up to the book, as that was one of the funniest books I've read in years. Maybe I should tell about some great books I've read, like the Wheel of Time series I'm currently reading [great fantasy, way better written than Tolkien's books, same Middle Earth]. Nah, that's too standard in the blogosphere. Besides, I'm currently too hooked on that series to write about other books ;) Maybe if I finish the current book, I'll reread The Hitchhiker's Guide. Ah, and then I'll start in <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/billbryson/bb_title/display.pperl?0-7679-0818-X">A Short History of Nearly Everything</a>.</p>

<p>End of braindump, continuing online roams.</p>
