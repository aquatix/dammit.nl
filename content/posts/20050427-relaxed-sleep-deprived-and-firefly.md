<p>The weekend was fun; lots of relaxing, but not that much sleep [too much fun until too late in the evenings :)]. They had a seriously nice swimming pool complex in the park, so we spent half a day there. The rest was consumed with doing other fun stuff, gaming [the analog way], some sightseeing and relaxing in the bungalow with a view of squirrels, lots of ducks [!] and some interesting birds. Lots of digicam work.</p>

<p>The voyages to get there and to get back where both by train, which kinda sucked, because, well, it took hours. And having to sit in the train for hours is tiring, even when reading The Dragon Reborn from the <a href="http://www.tor.com/jordan/">Wheel of time series</a>. And not having slept that much, continuing that trend a bit the next days, leaves me a bit groggy while working here.</p>

<p>Anyway, had fun watching <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/serenity/">the trailer of Serenity</a>, the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/">Firefly</a> movie a few hours back with some of my colleagues. I was reminded by Vermyndax again, so I thought I'd mention it here too. I need to finish the series too, but I've the episodes already on my laptop :)</p>
