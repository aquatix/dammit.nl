<p>First post from our new home, the apartment I moved in recently. Still busy with the project [damn J2EE...], which I should finish today-ish. Tonight there's a birthday party for both me and my dad, so that's going to be fun :)</p>

<p>Because quite a lot people couldn't join the party on the 12th of February because they already had other dates. Sooo, I'm moving the date to exactly a month later: the 12th of March there's going to be a party at our new place! I hope more people will share in the fun!</p>
