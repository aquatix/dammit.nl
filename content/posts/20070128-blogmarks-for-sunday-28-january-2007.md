<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.robweir.com/blog/2007/01/linuss-law-applied-to-standards-review.html">Linus's Law Applied to Standards Review</a></h3>
<p>And even more weird stuff found in Microsoft's OOXML document specifications. It seems it would be really bad when this version is made official because it contradicts existing standards.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.burtonini.com/blog/computers/lemonade-2007-01-23-13-10">Drink The Lemonade: building a *fast* mobile email client</a></h3>
<blockquote><p> That all said, once it's started, it connects to the mailserver over GPRS in about 10 seconds and pulls up the summary listing in 15, with a mailbox size of 2,882 messages. With a mailbox with 33,732 messages in, it's a little slower at around 25 seconds. That's still way faster than a desktop client on a LAN, of course, unless that desktop client is Polymer - in which case it'll seem remarkably slow.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/21/ubuntu_studio_linux_.html">Ubuntu studio - Linux for multimedia creation</a></h3>
<p>Hm, finally some nice multimedia authoring suite for Linux. Of course there are already some nice audio editors [Audacious, Sweep etc] and samplers [LMMS, Hydrogen], but this looks promising!</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/21/instapundit_vista_dr.html">Instapundit: Vista DRM may crap up commercial HD video, but...</a></h3>
<p>Sooo... amateur material will look better than professional [Holywood] material on a high-dev Vista machina.</p>

<blockquote><p>So perhaps all the fancy HDTVs people are buying will be showing homemade video because it looks better. Maybe this is all a clever Microsoft plan to take Hollywood down, all while appearing to do its bidding.</p></blockquote>
