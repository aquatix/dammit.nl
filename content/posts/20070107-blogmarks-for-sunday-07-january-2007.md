<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.chipx86.com/blog/?p=197">Subverting Subversion</a></h3>
<p>How to setup SVN to ignore certain files. Also handy is the auto-mimetyping of files:</p>

<blockquote><p>the following bits from my ~/.subversion/config file will automatically set the mime-type for new images being added, so that they can be properly viewed from the web interface:</p>
<pre>
[miscellany]
enable-auto-props = yes

[auto-props]
*.png = svn:mime-type=image/png
*.jpg = svn:mime-type=image/jpeg
*.svg = svn:mime-type=image/svg+xml
*.svgz = svn:mime-type=image/svg+xml
*.xcf = svn:mime-type=image/x-xcf
*.xcf.gz = svn:mime-type=image/x-compressed-xcf
*.xcf.bz2 = svn:mime-type=image/x-compressed-xcf
*.ico = svn:mime-type=image/x-ico
</pre>

<p>Another techie switching away from the windows platform [to Linux even :)]. If this trend continues, the future could become very interesting in Operating System land. I completely switched to a Free platform a year ago when my laptop's hard disk broke and I couldn't think of a reason to put back Windows XP in a dual boot configuration [which was the last installed windows copy on one of my machines; not that I used it often anymore even then]. Never looked back.</p>
