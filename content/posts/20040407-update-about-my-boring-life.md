<p>Well, not quite boring, but not very exiting either. I got my Clie and foldable keyboard on Monday [while I was at work, so I had to wait half a day to come home and play with it... :)]. They both work great. The Clie TH55 has such a nice screen [it's 6 times larger - in pixels - then my previous, grayscale one. And it's full colour; yay =)]. It even plays mp3!</p>
<p>So basically, I've been playing along the last two days, reading some news and blogs and draining the battery of the pda by fiddling some more with it. I was trying to setup the wifi settings for my university in it - it supports wep encryption and other neat stuff - but the university uses a root certificate [my laptop needs a special program to authenticate]. I don't know whether I will be able to log in with the unit at all. Would be a shame if I couldn't... That was one of the reasons I wanted wifi on it [reading <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> and other more interesting stuff] while attending classes. Ah well, I'll see, and if it doesn't work, I'll live. I'll bug the sysadmins somewhat, but I'll live :)</p>
<p>Hm, maybe it's time for doing some homework for tomorrow. *wanders off*</p>
