<p>Pong. Just to say I'm still alive ;)</p>
<p>Working 6 days a week is easier then I thought it would be. I get loads of stuff done. For my work that is. I hope I can sustain a comparable rhythm when this working spree is over, so I can get some work done at my own projects and school :)</p>
<p>Lousy thing at working so much is that I'm going to sit inside behind a pc tomorrow, while it's going to be 30 degrees Celcius outside. Ah well, there seems to be beer in their fridge ;)</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, WHERE THE HELL STAYS MY NEW LAPTOP? Sorry focks, just anxious ;) Stupid banks...</p>
