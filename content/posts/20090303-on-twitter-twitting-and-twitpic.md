<p>People around me and around the globe use <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> to stay updated with the day-to-day (and sometimes minute-to-minute) things in the lives of others. Myself I barely have time and energy to post updates here and keep up with the news and my comics feed, so have skipped the Twitter hype completely. I made an interesting discovery/connection today though; people are using <a href="http://twitpic.com/">twitpic</a> to quickly post pictures online from their cellphone and such. I remembered a meaning of "twit" that was somehow quite interesting in the context of both "twitpic" and "twitter":</p>

<p>twit<br />
â€“noun Informal.<br />
an insignificant or bothersome person.<br />
Origin:<br />
1920â€“25; perh. orig. n. deriv. of twit 1 , i.e., "one who twits others," but altered in sense by assoc. with expressive words with tw- (twaddle, twat, twerp, etc.) and by rhyme with nitwit</p>

<p>(<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/twit">Source</a>; see meaning 3)</p>

<p>I found it striking :)</p>
