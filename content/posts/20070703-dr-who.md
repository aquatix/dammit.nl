<p>I have a craving. A television channel here in the Netherlands aired the first season of the new Dr. Who episodes a good two years back, but I've not seen any new ones after that. As my girlfriend prefers not having to concentrate on English after a day hard work, it would be nice to have subtitled episodes to the home. Besides, at the moment I don't even have the hard disk space to download the two latest seasons :(</p>

<p>So, here's a cry-out to $DUTCH_TV_CHANNEL: please, please air those new Dr. Who episodes. Then we'll finally have something decent on the television again...</p>
