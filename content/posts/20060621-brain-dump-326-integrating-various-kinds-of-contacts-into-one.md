<p>So I'm carying a PalmOS pda and a cellphone with contacts. On my workstations I have <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> with its address book, <a href="http://jpilot.org/">JPilot</a> for synchronising my pda with, <a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">Gaim</a> for IM'ing friends and the SIP based <a href="http://www.gnomemeeting.org/">Ekiga</a> for Voice over IP [I won't talk about Skype, as they seem to not care about any other platform than windows anyway]. That's quite some varying places to keep contact information, and this way I have to search for all my correspondence with a certain person [about a certain subject] in all kinds of places. OK, <a href="http://beaglewiki.org/">Beagle</a> may be a help on my workstations, but it isn't nearly as exact as I'd want it to be.</p>

<p>What I really would like to have, is a program [a really souped-up <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution/">Evolution</a>? The current version still has a long way to go in my opinion] which incorporates all this. It should provide an overview of your contacts, with their physical addresses [multiple if possible, for work etc], their phone numbers[, fax numbers], e-mail addresses, IM addresses, VoIP addresses and be synchronisable with my pda, cellphone and preferably with another workstation too [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldav">CalDAV</a>, <a href="http://www.gracion.com/server/whatldap.html">LDAP directory</a>? Ekiga and Evolution seem to be able to do so already]. It would provide filters for "see all of your conversations/conversation information with this contact" to give a list with email threads, IM correspondence, times of VoIP calls [recordings?] etc.</p>

<p>Evolution is quite a beast, but with some force behind stabilising and streamlining its code and some love for it's e-mail handling [I would like it if they took a look at how Thunderbird does things, for example with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/348/">Quick File extension</a>, and the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/347/">QuoteCollapse</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/170/">Quote Colors</a> extensions] and if it would support virtual folders, it would be a lot better already. Those virtual folders I use for grouping emails about a certain subject together, based on contacts, subject and such, looking in various of the real email folders.</p>

<p>Plus, if it's to be an Evolution-like program, it would be nice if you could couple events/meetings, todo's etc to contacts [like I already can on my Palm with Iambic's Agendus. Maybe I'd better start providing patches :P</p>
