<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.jurecuhalev.com/blog/?p=174">Differences between developers from various parts of the world</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Yes means: "I understand what you say" vs. Yes means: "I agree with what you say"</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A couple of weeks ago we reported on the work of <a href="https://www.msu.edu/%7Elenski/">Richard Lenski</a>, who has spent much of the last 20 years <a href="https://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/">maintaining cultures of <span style="font-style: italic;">E. coli</span> to see how they evolve</a>. His <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0803151105">paper</a> describes how one of his populations <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/evolution/dn14094-bacteria-make-major-evolutionary-shift-in-the-lab.html">evolved the ability to metabolise citrate</a>, something <span style="font-style: italic;">E. coli</span> cannot do by definition.</p>
<p>It's one of the most dramatic examples of evolution in action ever seen, and because Lenski freezes samples of the population every 500 generations, it is possible to go back and track how the ability developed. Lenski and his team are now doing so, and hope to have a detailed history of the ability developing, mutation by mutation.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>First up was <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15120474.100-review--the-god-of-the-tiny-gaps.html">Michael Behe</a>, the intelligent design proponent and biochemist, who <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/post/PLNK3U696N278Z93O">argued in his Amazon blog</a> that Lenski's work was in fact excellent evidence for <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19225824.000-intelligent-design-the-god-lab.html">intelligent design</a>. His argument is a variant on the usual "<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn13694-evolution-myths-evolution-is-just-so-unlikely.html">it's just so improbable</a>" line: the ability to metabolise citrate required several different mutations (true), which each have a low chance of happening in a given time (true), and it may even have been necessary for them to happen in a particular order (true), therefore Darwinian evolution can't explain it. Er, no, it just means it would take evolution a little while to manage it. 20 years, as it turned out.</p>

<p>Good stuff</p>
<h3><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/06/19/teach-the-controversy">Teach The Controversy About Barack Obama</a></h3>
<p>This one quite cracked me up. I'm quite neutral on the US candidates, but this was a nice read.</p>

<blockquote><p>Barack Obama wears a FLAG PIN at all times, even in the shower. One time he DROPPED THE PIN down the drain, and he PATRIOTICALLY disassembled his entire plumbing to retrieve it.</p>
<p>Barack Obama says the PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE every time he sees an American flag, and he has an American flag in EVERY ROOM in his house. Some days it takes him OVER 45 MINUTES to get out of his house. He also ends every sentence by saying, "WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL." On the INTERNET there is video of Obama quietly mouthing the PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE in his sleep.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Barack Obama is a DEVOUT CHRISTIAN. His favorite book is the BIBLE, which he has memorized. His name means HE WHO LOVES JESUS in the ancient language of Aramaic, which is the language JESUS SPOKE before he learned English. He is PROUD that Jesus was an American.</p></blockquote>
