[EuroPython 2017](https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/)

## Day zero, Sunday

After a rather pleasant flight on Sunday morning, where out of 80 passengers, I sat next to the only other EuroPython visitor, I took a nicely airconditioned train from Bologna to Rimini. I really hoped that airco was everywhere, otherwise the 33C would seriously hamper my capability of even remembering what was said just five minutes ago.

My newfound acquaintance and me got some good Italian food inside us, cooled down for a few minutes at the beach, breathing in the sea air and explored Rimini centre for a bit, where the heat was slowly leaking out of the stones.


## Day one, Monday

Moving on to Monday, I was thankfully doing just fine. The walk through the park (literally) to the venue was warm and lengthy but shady and beautiful, and the venue was well organised and cool, suiting my feeble brain.

Starting off with an enlightening keynote by Armin Ronacher, where we were reminded of the fact that files and other input still are not UTF-8 (even going beyond UTF-8 now we have emoticons, which are in an even higher byte space), making it hard to do string slicing and such. Also, don't subclass dictionaries. Just don't.

I moved on to a hands-on session with Django and Celery, as I wanted to see if there were some features I wasn't aware of yet, or pointers to solutions to some minor issues we are having at Sanoma.



It's refreshing to see the amount of female attendees. I really hope it's a good sign for the future, as in my opinion we need more of their talent in our field of work.


## Day two, Tuesday

Instead of walking, I decided to make use of the loaner bikes of the hotel, which was really an improvement.

Cooling down, the kickoff of the day was about data visualisation by Dutch visualiser Jan Willem Tulp. This was great to behold, seeing how he made big and complex datasets comprehensible and even beautiful, appealing to laymen too (his animated globe with number of trees was used in a nice demo from a news publication).
