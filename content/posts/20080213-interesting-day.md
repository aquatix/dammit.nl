<p>Today I woke up with both my servers being down; always a good way to start your day. higgs [my new vserver], turned out to not have booted after a reboot of the real server its located on - a simple 'boot' in the Xen console sufficed. The crew is investigating why some nodes didn't reboot.</p>

<p>My home server however, failed to boot. Again and again and again. That was enough to have me sweating. But today was also the day I got my Bachelor diploma, so I decided to put it out of my mind and enjoy the ride. My party crew was small, as I only had my lovely girlfriend along; I knew from experience that the issuing of Bachelor diploma's wasn't considered a big party at my faculty, so bringing along a lot of family and friends would only end in an anticlimax [imho]. The resulting meeting was nice, and even the talk-by-proxy from my Bachelor supervisor was good. So that was fun! We ended with a little sightseeing in the university building, which my girlfriend hadn't visited before, then went home [work to do...].</p>

<p>That reminded me that I still had a homeserver [with mailservice and webserver on it] to revive. It still wouldn't boot, but after some disassemblage, cleaning and a healty kick in the case, it wanted to post again. After plugging back the harddisk, it came to live. Praise the Light :) A quick apt-get later it was even running the latest Debian kernel, which shouldn't have <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=645">the vmsplice vulnerability</a> anymore. Time to get working on my projects again.</p>
