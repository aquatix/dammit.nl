<p>OK, while doing some work at work [*cough*] I've revamped the XUL Rich client version of <a href="/page/html/overload">overload</a>. It's not in the live version yet, but it will be very soon. <a href="/gallery/overload/">Check some screenshots of the evolution of the overload feedreader</a>. I need to give the xhtml frontend some love again, as Search now works. Ah, and finalize "Add feed" ;)</p>
