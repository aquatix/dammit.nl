<blockquote>
<p class="quote">You are 'French'.  In the nineteenth century, it was the international language of diplomacy. It is a 'beautiful' language, meaning that it is really just a low-fidelity copy of Latin.</p>

<p class="quote">You know the importance of communicating 'diplomatically', which for you means both being polite and friendly when necessary and using sophisticated, vicious sarcasm when appropriate.  Your life is guided by either existentialism or nihilism, depending on the weather.  You have a certain appreciation for the finer things in life, which is a diplomatic way of saying that you are a disgusting hedonist.  Your problem is that French has been obsolete for a long time.</p>
