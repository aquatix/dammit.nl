<p>Life lesson #6829: a weekend without a working internet connection sucks. Bigtime. The provider of the ADSL network [not <a href="http://www.demon.nl/">our internet service provider</a>] -- <a href="http://bbned.nl/">BBNed</a> -- has <a href="http://www.demon.nl/netwerkstatus/archief/2005/09/dsl_storing_bbn.html">major problems</a> [or so it seems] with their central networking stuff, so we experienced a network malfunction starting Friday morning 2:30AM and lasting till now [read: still going on as far as I can see].</p>

<p>I managed to get a connection through dial-in, but as we have a cheap phone landline we pay quite a bit per minute, so we only checked our mail and what was going on with the malfunctioning network. Our home is a bit cleaner because of the spare time this caused me tho' ;)</p>
