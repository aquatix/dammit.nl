<p>Nice day today. I woke up in a sunny world, even needing my sunglasses [to shield my painly eyes from the bright, but welcome sun]. Work went well [even migrated a project from MSSQL to MySQL :)], then fired up Quake III Arena to kick some colleagues' asses. It went quite well, and I even won! [That's quite good for me =)].</p>
<p>Then I went home and baked some eggs. For the first time :P [some colleagues will ROFL now, and maybe more people will ;)]. It was very edible :) Yay, /me rocks ;)</p>
<p>And now I'm sitting here, idling, reading some news, drinking a nice fruity Chili wine and just enjoying weekend for the first time in - er - times. *Surfs away*</p>
