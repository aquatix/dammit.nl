<p>So, what do you do after working for a week on a project for the university, writing the documentation in the weekend, testing the implementation with rules, drinking some wine on a birthday party and merging some more changes into the doc which needs to be handed in as hardcopy by Monday morning 9AM? Right, you just continue writing and hacking the rules. Who cares that it's 3AM ;)
