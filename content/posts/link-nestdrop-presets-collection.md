After [my piece on projectM]({filename}projectm-ubuntu-1910.md) last year, I installed it on several computers, not really thinking about extra `.milk` preset files (which contain the animations). Today, after some short searching thinking there might be more out there, I found this little gem of a collection:

> Presets Collection – Cream of the Crop
>
> I’ve spent a ton of time curating a best-of collection of presets for VJ’s to perform with. Over the years the Milkdrop community has released about 52,000 presets and so I selected only the best ones and ended up with 9,795 presets. I also organized the presets into categories and subcategories.

> * Collection of 9,795 Milkdrop presets
> * Includes preview images of each preset
> * Readme with install instructions

Suffice to say I now have too many presets to choose from ^_^
