<p>I started writing this as comment on <a href="/~mbscholt/?rantid=253#comment142">Vermyndax</a>, but I figured it would be better to post here.</p>

<p>Meh, it's more that I find myself overusing electronics. When I wake up, I get my pda and fetch my e-mail through wifi. Then I go get breakfast and may boot my laptop to read some news. On my way to university/work I read ebooks [quite fun/useful actually] or news/rssfeeds I crawled recently and downloaded to my pda with <a href="http://plkr.org">Plucker</a>.</p>

<p>When on an internet connection, I find myself checking my online feedreader [currently <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>, soon to be replaced with my own overload feedreader], reading news from various other sites, surfing for hours etc.</p>

<p>When I come home, I go sit on a couch, get my laptop booted on my lap and sit there until sleep calls. Even when we're watching some good series on television, the laptop is always nearby [can come in handy as tv guide, fact book or whatever].</p>

<p>It's just that I find myself looking at a pile of unread "Natuur en Techniek" magazines [a science magazine here in the Netherlands that's loaded with interesting articles I want to read, but just don't do, because I'm always reading other things]. And lots of other things to do, like housekeeping, my photographing hobby [where a digicam is a very handy tool], and even my old writing and drawing hobbies. Writing can be done on my pc too [as I've been doing all time], but most of my time I'm just sucking up information. Or reading a great series as the <a href="http://www.tor.com/jordan/">Wheel of time series</a>.</p>

<p>Sooo... basically I should just cut the crap and stop trying to get so much information fed to me. Problem is that I totally love information. I can't get enough of it. So I need to find a way to restrict my time taking it in and doing other [relaxing] things. My pda helps me spending my time more useful by letting me read some info while waiting for/sitting in a train, but I just have to cut down the information stream a bit I guess.</p>

<p>No clean cut with electronics/gadgets for me [as <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark</a> did], but my old problem of dividing my time better and cutting down the time I spend feeding myself information.</p>

<p>Phew, time for some beer.</p>

<p>BTW, it says something that I'm sometimes jealous of cats because of their almost careless life. Heh, except that they generally don't like beer :)</p>
