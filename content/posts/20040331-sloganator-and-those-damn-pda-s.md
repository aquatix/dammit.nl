<p><a href="http://revbilly.com/revsite/sloganator1/sloganator/index.html">The Sloganator me be dead, but the posters live on</a>. Some of the posters made on the make-your-own-slogan-poster-tool from the Bush-n-Cheney bunch.</p>
<p>On a different note: my interest in those Sharp Zaurus pda's was reawakened today when I came along someone who has on of the earlier models. I would really, really like to have the <a href="http://www.shirtpocket.co.uk/cat/product_info.php?products_id=85">Sharp Zaurus C860</a>, but why does it have to be so damn expensive? It's 847.40 EUR plus 74.92 EUR for a wifi card [and that one is a Special Purchase]. That's 922.32 EUR for a damn fine gadget. And I'm only a poor student... Maybe I can scrape together some savings and such =)</p>
<p>Am I *this* addicted to quality wannahaves?</p>
