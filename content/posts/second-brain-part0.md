I have been thinking lately about how I organise my thoughts, notes, files, incoming messages, and much more.

Various Git repositories, a few big-ish directories that I keep in sync over my various machines using [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).

TickTick for todo's, Google Keep for quick notes (also to share with my significant other).

I collect useful methods and other links [on my second brain link page](https://marks.diginaut.net/pub/f45a9fd1b6b8735399018e1b8b653b5d).
