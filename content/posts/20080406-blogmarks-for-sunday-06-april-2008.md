<h3><a href="http://jwz.livejournal.com/856745.html">Happy Run Some Old Web Browsers Day!</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Until now,
<a href="http://home.mcom.com/">home.mcom.com</a> and all URLs under it
just redirected to netscape.com, then redirected a dozen more times
before taking you to some AOL portal page. The old URLs that were
baked into the toolbar buttons of the original web browsers didn't
work any more. But now, if you fire up a copy of Mosaic Netscape 0.9,
and click on the various toolbar buttons, they will work again! For
example, in the old browsers, when you clicked on the "What's New"
toolbar button, it went
<a href="http://home.mcom.com/home/whats-new.html">here</a>.

<blockquote><p>"Rhythms are part of our biology," Smith said, more important than position papers, endorsements or experience. "Name sounds are something the voter is comfortable with or uncomfortable with."</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The last presidential election did not follow Smith's formula. Kerry scored higher as a name than Bush, but John Kerry still lost the election. It was the first time the higher-rated name lost since the 1936 election when Franklin Roosevelt beat Alf Landon, Smith said. The biggest loser of all time is William Jennings Bryan, the Democrat who ran for the presidency three times, had the superior name three times and lost three times.</p>

<p>"He really screws up my average," Smith said.</p></blockquote>
