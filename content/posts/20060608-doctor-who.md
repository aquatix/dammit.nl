<p>Who? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Doctor Who</a>! On our television. In a time where everything else on that medium sucks [e.g., football -- what's the matter with that anyhow? -- all interesting series ended, etc] we get that fine series broadcasted right into our living room. Hey, and it's right behind two hours of South Park on another channel too; makes for an interesting alternative for my PC on the Saturday evening.</p>
