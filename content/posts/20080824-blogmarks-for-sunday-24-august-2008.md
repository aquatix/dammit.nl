<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/08/15/how-to-get-into-a-cl.html">How to get into a club by pretending you're a DJ</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>These Australian guys conducted an experiment and videotaped it: Can you beat the lines at a club and get in by wearing a record bag and pretending to be a DJ?</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/08/15/former-seattle-polic.html">Former Seattle Police Chief on the high costs of the drug war</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>[...] the war on drugs, which he believes causes untold misery, undermines effective law enforcement, and doesn't begin to pass any sort of cost-benefit analysis.</blockquote></p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/08/15/bibliography-of-euro.html">Bibliography of Europe's largest, private collection of Science Fiction novels.</a></h3>
<blockquote>Heinz-J&uuml;rgen Ehrig, a German Science Fiction fan, has collected about 130.000 Science Fiction books, magazines, fanzines, etc. Since his death in 2003, his widow, the SciFi author Marianne Sydow has spend gazillions of hours cataloguing his collection and is now publishing the bibliographical data on a monthly basis in a paperback + CD outfit for a small fee. Unfortunately she finds it hard to get any subscribers, which is a shame really. It would be a shame if this project dies. More here - I think I'm the only one who brought this more or less to the attention of the "outside Germany" world.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow...</p>
