Apart from tiredness because of energy going into raising a child and sometimes the lack of sleep because of that, I increasingly find myself forgetting things. Be it appointments, things I promised (myself and others) to do, where I placed (physical) things and sometimes even the time (but that's nothing new really). Also, overlooking things like requirements on a form, bugs and errors that are obvious in hindsight and more. Of course, debugging is interesting, if you're awake and fit or less so, but I find myself making slightly more errors than I'm used from myself.

This annoys me. Not only isn't it nice to make faults,

## Distraction-free zone

Disable your email checks, your feed readers, social media push messages. Close as much browser as you're comfortable with. Put on headphones and some favourite music (preferably not new, as you're more inclined to listen to it than to use it as audeine - e.g., to get in the flow with it).
