<p>Well, everybody has some goals for the new year I guess. Mine are basically the same every year--much like anybody else--and are listed here for future reference [no particular order]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan. Plan better, more, and do it all according that planning</li>
<li>Get from behind that huge CRT or crawl from beneath that laptop. I've quite a few other hobbies that need some love</li>
<li>Get my fscking BSc for Computer Science [I'm already doing Master courses...]</li>
<li>Organize my snail mail and other paper work better. I hope I will do this right from the fresh start soon in my new apartment</li>
<li>Try to get done more in a day. Still the ol' planning problem I guess, but maybe some motivation to do other things than soaking up information from behind a screen will help too</li>
<li>In line of the previous point: create more. I like creating cool things, and I feel like I've done that to little last year [however this weblog and my English has improved quite a bit]</li>
</ul>
<p>That was about it; at least the major points are covered I think. It has almost nothing to do with <a href="http://morphix.org">morphing</a> [except for the last two points], this list has some value to me. And that's what this weblog is about: writing about me, for me. But I love my readers ;)</p>
