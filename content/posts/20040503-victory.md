<p>I just booted XCalibur, my server, successfully. I replaced the motherboard [the other was b0rked, if I'm right], so now it has a nice Asus A7V8X-X heart. However, this has onboard LAN, so I left out the ethernet card. But then the Woody install didn't have LAN anymore. Turned out that the module via-rhine has to be loaded [/etc/modules :)]. And now we are up again!!!</p>
<p>On a quick note [I'm going to sleep Real Soon Now(tm)]: Kill Bill 1&amp;2 are fantastic! Great movies, interesting story and very good soundtracks.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to sleep. Finally. [Was kinda late last night =)]</p>
