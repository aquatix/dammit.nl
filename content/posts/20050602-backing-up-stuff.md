<p>Chatting on #morphix with the good ol' <a href="http://morphix.org">Morphix</a> crew, we came along the subject of backing up your cruft [ahum]. Anyway, as I'm lazy and have been running scripts to do so for quite some time already, I thought it nice to share those with the world.</p>

<p>I've put two scripts online: <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/linux/backup/">my daily/weekly/monthly backup script for homedirs and /etc etc</a>, and <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/linux/backup_db/">a script for automatically dumping database files on a weekly/monthly base</a>. Of course you need to adjust those to fit your own system, but with a little fiddling [and a bit cleaning up], you have a nice cronjob-driven backup system :)</p>
