<p>So, just over a week ago, I received my <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos400d/">Canon EOS 400D</a> with nice <a href="http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-S-17-85mm-f-4-5.6-IS-USM-Lens-Review.aspx">EFS 17-85mm lense</a> [and a nice flash of course]. I've been shooting random stuff with it since then, and really like the camera. I also really like the sound the mirror makes when you take a picture. How did I ever manage without a dSLR? :)</p>

<p>For some pictures I took with it, look at <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/v/photographs/nature/weather/img_0160.jpg.html">these cloud pictures</a> [that picture and the next several. <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/v/photographs/nature/weather/?g2_page=2">See this page for an overview</a>]. <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/v/photographs/homepics/img_0183.jpg.html">An indoor picture of my desk</a> can be found in another gallery. You can recognise the Canon pics on the <code>img_</code> prefix.</p>
