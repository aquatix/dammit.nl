<p>You hear it well, Satan's gone scating: <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/linux/aquamorph/">I finally released a new aquamorph</a>! At this moment it's only hosted on this not-too-fast server, so if you can wait half a day, check back tomorrow when I've uploaded it to a faster server :)</p>

<p>It even has a manual:</p>
