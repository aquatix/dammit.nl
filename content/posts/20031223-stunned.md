<p>Well, just saw Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. And I'm dumbstruck. Damn what a fine movie! Didn't follow the book at every point, but that's only for the good. It was a long sit [bladder acked from the cola ;)], but it was 3,5h pure excitement, emotions, huge battles [well done directors!] and 1 small golden ring.</p>
<p>It leaves no doubt I'm impressed. It didn't follow the book at all points as I said, but quite accurately in most [hell, I didn't even read the book :D]. Cities where great [especially the city of Kings, Minas Tirith], personalities very good [Gollum/Smeagol deserves another Oscar allright] and the fights thrilled me each time again.</p>
<p>Well, enough for today, I'm of for some dream-featured sleep ;)</p>
