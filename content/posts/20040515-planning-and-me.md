<p>So I'm facing a nice busy schedule for the next two months or something, which I'm hoping to survive by planning my days better [<a href="index.php?rantid=113">see the post by Jeremy C. Wright</a>], getting myself in a rhythm again [I think <a href="index.php?rantid=116">the idea of Manuzhai to wake up at 9AM</a> even if I don't have to may force me in one] and start studying early. The latter is important, because in about a week and a half I'm having some exams again, for which I still have to start studying for. So spending evenings in a lazy chair with some books will be better for me then spending those evenings doing tons of useless things behind my workstation.</p>
<p>When I'm motivated enough [like in "I want to finish those darn Bachelor courses"], plan my days and filter out unnesessary tasks [like doing the hourly blogs check], I'm going to be fine and may even have time left to built some nice things [like my <a href="/">aquariusoft.org website</a> or Morphix tools or something].</p>
<p>Go me, go me!</p>
