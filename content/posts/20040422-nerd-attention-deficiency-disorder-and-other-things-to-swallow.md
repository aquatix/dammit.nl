<p>I keep on posting today :)</p>
<p>I came along<a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html">Nerd Attention Deficiency Disorder</a> [short: NADD], which, erm, fits me fairly well. I don't know if that's good or bad, but it enables me to sift through huge amounts of information in a short time. A <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/02/15/in_defense_of_nadd.html">follow-up story, In Defense of N.A.D.D.</a> is available too. Good reads.</p>

<p>Another interesting article from the same guy is about <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/04/19/heinous.html">Heinous</a>, or the bug that's going to eat your company when you release your software with it. His text is about software development and the disasters you have to endure. Use Heinous, but with care.</p>

<p>This guy has some really great pieces about software development. <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/03/14/were_doomed.html">We're Doomed</a> is another one.</p>

<p>Just <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/">check him out</a> :)</p>
