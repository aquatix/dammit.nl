<p>This week I have to do two examinations, and wrap up other things, but then I can sit back and relax a bit. Saturday the 24th an old friend comes visiting us, and will bring the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013442/">Nosferatu</a> with her. Old vampires galore :)</p>
<p>After that, days of celebrating we have a nice family, with the obligatory food, wine and other niceties. Then the old year already is on its end, and a fresh 2006 is awaiting us. Time flies by too freaking fast...</p>
