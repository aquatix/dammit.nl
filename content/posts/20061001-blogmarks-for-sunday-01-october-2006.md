<p>Talking about that <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=442">personal network</a>, these watches would blend in too. Be it they're a tad *too* geeky ;)</p>

<p>An e-book reader with ePaper. Screen looks *really* nice, but what's up with that "synching" [will that work for non-windows pc's?] and DRMed books?</p>
<h3><a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060320-6417.html">Time magazine: multitasking is bad for you</a></h3>

<h3><a href="http://dbaron.org/log/2006-09#e20060921a">New Theme, Old Problem</a></h3>
<p>Firefox 2 features a new theme. With a new look for its tabs. A look that doesn't blend in with the rest of your environment. What's up with that?</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.nu.nl/news/832688/122/Baby_overleeft_val_van_vier_hoog_%28video%29.html">[Dutch] Baby overleeft val van vier hoog</a></h3>
<p>A 10 months young baby boy fell from the fourth floor of the flat opposite ours. It survived [didn't even break anything], but it shook things up quite a bit; why did he fall out of the window, where he was supposed to sleep in his bed? Got some nice view on the trauma helicopter, which thankfully wasn't needed. Pics follow :)</p>
