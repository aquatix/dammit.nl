<p>I've not been posting much lately, but I've been quite busy. No real excuse, I know, but it's the best I have ;)</p>

<p>I'm still preparing a largish post on our recent move to a newer, bigger, better home. I need to fix some images for it, and wrap it all up. It'll likely be posted this coming week. In the meanwhile I'm still hoping they fix my ADSL connection sooner than later, as I'm getting a bit tired of repeating that single open wifi signal to my own network. Besides, 20MBit down and 1MBit up is a tad faster than what I currently have ;) [not to speak about latency...]</p>

<p>Ah, and that connection would enable me to move my server back from my parent's place to here, which means I can listen to all my music again :)</p>
