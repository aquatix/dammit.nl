<p>I've been rather quiet for some time now, due to the warm weather, a lack of interest [my feedreader is becoming rather full of unread items] and a need of a break. That break is coming now: we're leaving on vacation in another hour. Just me, my beautiful GF and a tent in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardennes">Ardennes</a> in Belgium. Really nice surroundings, if I believe everyone that's been there. So I do ;)</p>

<p>Manuzhai: I've read <a href="http://www.manuzhai.nl/weblog/comments/the-long-awaited-music-baton/">your post about the music baton</a> and I've even started writing my own post, but it has to wait until I come back. Just another week ;)</p>

<p>OK folks, enjoy the fine weather! Even when it's wet :)</p>
