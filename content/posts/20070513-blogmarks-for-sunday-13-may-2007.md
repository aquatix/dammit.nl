<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://tapas.affenbande.org/wordpress/?page_id=70">Pidgin LaTeX</a></h3>
<p>Finally a way to do nice formulas in your favourite IM client</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.jessamyn.com/journal/2007/05/weird-little-radar-blip.html">Librarian girl makes installing Linux fun - a movie</a></h3>
<p>This interesting gall installed Ubuntu on two donated machines for her library. The fun part is that it all seems fun to do; an emotion that was sometimes lacking while doing this task [not counting geeks like me wanting things to go awry to be able to go full-out fixing it :)].</p>

<p><a href="http://www.librarian.net/stax/2042/do-you-ubuntu/">The original article with YouTube movie</a></p>
<h3><a href="http://creativebits.org/cool_business_card_designs">Cool business card designs | creativebits</a></h3>
<p>Inspire</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.openchange.org/">OpenChange - open source Exchange interaction</a></h3>
<p>Everything seems to be pretty alpha quality still, but it looks pretty promising. Will we have a decent open source implementation of the Exchange MAPI protocol soon? Now only to have a nice alternative of Exchange :)</p>
