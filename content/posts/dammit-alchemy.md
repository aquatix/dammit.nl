Today I've been busy with a family party and with a total restyle of this weblog based on [Pelican Alchemy Bootstrap 4](https://github.com/nairobilug/pelican-alchemy) and the [Bootswatch Lux theme](https://bootswatch.com/lux/), with my own twist in dark-ish grey. Currently it is generating from [my own fork](https://github.com/aquatix/pelican-alchemy/tree/dammit) with [isso](https://github.com/posativ/isso) comment support and article images.

Breakage might occur, and I'll likely tweak a bit further. I might even revert back to the olive green used for so many years, but at the moment I'm quite happy with my monochromatic shades.
