<p>When I have this blog I put a lot of my free time in, I should use it too. So, after almost a week of hard work [some classes and lots of - erm - blog and news reading =)], here I am again. As I said last night I spent half a day yesterday at redesigning the frontend of the <a href="/">aquariusoft.org website</a>. I made a mockup and should be implementing it in the templates soon, but I've to work on an assignment for a course I attend.</p>
<p>Well, that's not the right way to say it, but the <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ralf/cpp/">C++ course</a> is a way to get me an extra 2 ects points. My C skills are way above the ones needed, but maybe I can get a C++ implementation out of this; that's something I've to learn myself yet. However, the deadline is next Friday, and I've other things to do too. Hm.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm off to get me some breakfast. Shouldn't sleep this late and then power on my workstation immediately. Ah well, that's life :)</p>
