<p>It's <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/03/day_against_drm_toda.html">the day against DRM today</a>. Say no to those crippling techniques too. Say yes to being able to use your purchases on the devices you like to use it on, and not the one[s] where the companies want you to play it on. Say yes to Freedom!</p>
