<p>Over the years I seem to have made a point of saying I need to dust off this weblog and post more instead of hanging around on ethereal media like Twitter or getting sidetracked by real life. I'm still trying to figure out a way of getting dammIT in my (daily?) system, but at least I made it more fun for me to do so by rewriting large chunks of it and bringing the visible part into this decades tech mindset.</p>

<p>It's not finished, it's not guaranteed to be perfect, but I really like how it worked out. Try dragging your browser window wider and smaller (the sidebar changes) and look at it on you mobile devices too, it's responsive :)</p>

<p>Some before/after images might be posted next; first for some Sunday real life distractions.</p>
