<p>I just checked a log file from my mail server and noticed quite a bunch of deliveries. Turned out one address on my domain was being spammed with over 13 thousand identical spam messages. In a couple of hours. Resulting in:</p>
<p>-rw-rw----    1 [username]  mail     108385920 May 29 13:18 [nameoftheinbox]</p>
<p>Also known as one bigass inbox. <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/linux/20050530_lotsa_spam">Check the screenie</a>. Anybody knows someone at bookrepublic.com? You or your network is hacked, dumbass, and that lamer is abusing my own root address for delivering 13647 identical spam messages to a mailbox I rarely read. Ah well.</p>
