<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/09/03/the-militarization-o.html">The militarization of our police and raids gone wrong</a></h3>
<p>Police in the US seems to get more aggressive:</p>
<blockquote><p>All across America, local police units are arming and training officers to bust down doors, destroy personal property and mercilessly manhandle all living creatures in their path. Dogs, children and even elderly women have been shot by rampaging SWAT teams, usually in the hunt for trivial amounts of drug contraband.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/30/science-fiction-writ-1.html">Science Fiction Writers of America abuses the DMCA</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> from boingboing writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America has used the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to fraudulently remove numerous non-infringing works from Scribd, a site that allows the general public to share text files with one another in much the same way that Flickr allows its users to share pictures.</p>
<p>Included in the takedown were: a junior high teacher's bibliography of works that will excite children about reading sf, the back-catalog of a magazine called <a href="http://raygunrevival.com/">Ray Gun Revival,</a> books by other authors who have never authorized SFWA to act on their behalf, such as Bruce Sterling, and my own Creative Commons-licensed novel, "Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom."</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>More importantly, many of the works that were listed in the takedown were written by the people who'd posted them to Scribd -- these people have been maligned and harmed by SFWA, who have accused them of being copyright violators and have caused their material to be taken offline. These people made the mistake of <em>talking about</em> and <em>promoting</em> science fiction -- by compiling a bibliography of good works to turn kids onto science fiction, by writing critical or personal essays that quoted science fiction novels, or by discussing science fiction. SFWA -- whose business is to promote science fiction reading -- has turned readers into collateral damage in  a campaign to make Scribd change its upload procedures.</p></blockquote>

<p>Weird stuff, and a good response from Cory. Check the story for the full text.</p>
