It was a pretty good week this week. At work, a big project is nearing realisation, kids have been spending their energy playing outside, and I finally finished two sagas.

![Battlestar Galactica main characters](https://shuttereye.org/galleries/various/dammit/battlestar_galactica.jpg)

The first was Battlestar Galactica which for numerous reasons was a multiyear endeavour for me. But what a finale! Suitable for the series, a proper saga. I know some people who are jealous I was watching it for the first time :)

Secondly, last night I finished reading [Judas Unchained](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45244.Judas_Unchained), which together with [Pandora's Star](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45252.Pandora_s_Star) is the Commonwealth Saga, and a very interesting tale of some intriguing happenings in a distant future of mankind.

That second book only took me three months or so (and I started reading the first book last August), which [should not surprise me]({filename}need-recharging.md) but somewhat irked me nonetheless, until I realised those two volumes together are basically eight novels with a total of 1600 pages. As [one reviewer on Goodread puts it](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2488329397?book_show_action=true):

> There's full-flung mil-SF, political intrigue SF, murder-mystery and spy SF, revolutionary thriller SF, media-scoop SF, as well as hardcore alien Hard-SF with Big Dumb Objects galore, miniature wormhole attacks, rejuvenation, memory cores so you can get a new body, as well as a LOT of nova'd stars. Big-ass scale.

Having finally finished it still feels a bit odd, and I can highly recommend it. Peter F. Hamilton did some great worldbuilding here.
