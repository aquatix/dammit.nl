<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/03/timeline_of_words_us.html">Timeline of words used in Presidential speeches (1776 - 2006)</a></h3>
<p>Heh, fun :)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/03/microsoft_orphans_su.html">Microsoft orphans suckers who bought DRM music</a></h3>

<h3><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/01.html">What's a SQL Injection Bug?</a></h3>
<p>For the uninitiated: what is a SQL Injection Bug, and a way to circumvent them in PHP is using <a href="http://nl2.php.net/mysql_real_escape_string">mysql_real_escape_string</a>. Please Google the matter if you are new to this, it's important</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/31/london_underground_m.html">London Underground maps that are free as in speech</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The Wikimedia project has a series of excellent, heavily annotated free maps of the London Underground -- a boon in an era where the London Underground treats riders who remix the transit map as criminals and <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/22/transport_for_london.html">threatens to sue them</a>.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/31/haunted_mansion_trib.html">Haunted Mansion tribute from a young filmmaker</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>A young filmmaker produced a stop-motion animation short film based on Disneyland's Haunted Mansion, ingeniously blending construction paper backgroups, doll-house props, plastercine figures and artwork from the original ride.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/31/snitch_sticker_in_yo.html">Snitch sticker in your phone reports water damage</a></h3>
<p>Ah, so that's how they knew that crushed phone from me wasn't damaged by a bus, but was simply dropped in the toilet ;)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/31/last_minute_changes_.html">Last minute changes snuck into Aussie DMCA</a></h3>
<p>What's it with governments and sneaking in changes into rushed new bills? Besides several other lacks of legal protection there's more:</p>

<blockquote><p>But that's not the only problem with the bill. It also creates new criminal penalties for copyright infringement. It introduces new summary and strict liability offences and criminal penalties for non-commercial infringement. These rules would apply to children as young as 14, and could make everyday Australians criminals for uploading lip-synched videos to YouTube and other commonplace activities.</p></blockquote>

<p>Gotta love that; now kids aren't even allowed to upload some playback'ed movies to Youtube or whatever; even worse, they are likely to be prosecuted!</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/31/evolutionary_basis_f.html">Evolutionary basis for self-delusion?</a></h3>

And the fun part is that it features outer-space environments without using CGI. Read on for the how</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/30/by_eating_this_food_.html">By eating this food, you agree to the following:</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Andy Sternberg's "Small Print Project" continues to rack up astounding examples of crummy "user agreements" that you find yourself entering into by buying goods and services. Seems like no one wants to "sell" you anything anymore -- everything comes with a lame-ass "agreement" that you don't get to negotiate.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/30/corys_new_usc_underg.html">Cory's new USC undergrad course: PWNED</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Every garden has a snake: computers aren't just tools for empowering their owners. They're also tools for stripping users of agency, for controlling us individually and en masse.</p>

<p>It starts with "Digital Rights Management" -- the anti-copying measures that computers employ to frustrate their owners desires. These technologies literally attack their owners, treating them as menaces to be thwarted through force majeure, deceit, and cunning. Incredibly, DRM gets special protection under the law, a blanket prohibition on breaking DRM or helping others to do so, even if you have the right to access the work the DRM is walling off.</p></blockquote>
