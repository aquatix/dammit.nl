<p>I've discovered <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a>. I had it installed some time now, but never used it until a friend of mine told me he always holds group chats on it. Well, installed the latest version and made fun until 3AM. Quite cool to have a headset on your head, make jokes and talk about stuff while being able to do whatever you like.</p>

<p>I know it's binary only, but the <a href="http://www.skype.com/products/skype/linux/">Linux version</a> works great for me. The <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> package doesn't contain the latest version, so I just grabbed the tarball from the Skype site and copied the binary over the installed one. Works great :)</p>

<p>So, anybody who's interested and wants to try it out, my skype id is aquatix.</p>
