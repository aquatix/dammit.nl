One of the ways I am attempting to keep my sanity, is by taking morning walks. Those walks serve both as some light exercise when working from home, and as a way of waking up and resetting my head by submitting myself to the fractals of nature, found in the greenery of gardens and a park near where I live.

With the days shortening, I lately find myself walking through the advancing dawn of the day. Together with some light fog, this makes for one of my favourite plays of light, which I wanted to share.
