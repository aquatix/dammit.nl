<h3><a href="http://people.w3.org/rishida/blog/?p=100">Personal names around the world</a></h3>
<p>Simply put: names are not the same for everyone; all over the world there are lots of ways people's names are constructed and used, so simply asking for "first name" and "last name" just is not the answer. Better ask for their "name", then ask later for how they would prefer to be addressed.</p>

<p>So microsoft has patented the advertising-invested operating system? Kudos to them; now nobody else will do that. LIKE WE WANT SUCH AN OS. *cough* I mean:</p>

<blockquote><p>[...] a just-published Microsoft patent application for an <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220070157227%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20070157227&amp;RS=DN/20070157227">Advertising Services Architecture</a>, which delivers targeted advertising as 'part of the OS.' Microsoft, who once teamed with law enforcement to <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/01/61742">protect consumers from unwanted advertising</a>, goes on to boast that the invention can 'take steps to verify ad consumption,' be used to block ads from competitors, and even sneak a peek at 'user document files, user e-mail files, user music files, downloaded podcasts, computer settings, [and] computer status messages' to deliver more tightly targeted ads."</p></blockquote>

<p>That means it will spy on you, your documents, your behaviour etc to *make sure* you get the ads consumed. It also makes sure you can't just turn it off or something. One of the comments <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=250123&amp;cid=19856433">wraps it up nicely</a>.</p>
