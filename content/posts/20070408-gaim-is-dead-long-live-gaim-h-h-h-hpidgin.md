<p>Today, I read <a href="http://pidgin.im/index.php?id=177">a posting on the Gaim weblog</a> that's big news in the project's history. It basically means Gaim doesn't exist anymore. But don't grieve, they've renamed it to <a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>. This all because of legal struggles with the nice company known as AOL. They also renamed their libgaim to libpurple and their text version of Gaim into Finch. Let's hope the brand recognition will soon kick in :) It worked with Firebird^WPhoenix too.</p>
<p>And all that while Debian GNU/Linux is busy releasing version 4.0 [Etch] with Gaim 2.0b5 :P</p>
