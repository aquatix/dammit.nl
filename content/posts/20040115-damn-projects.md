<p>Well, after finishing computer graphics it's now hurrying to get <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~cn/">Computer Networks</a> ready for the end of January [end before the last normal test at next Tuesday]... If that's not enough, I've got an exam at Monday the 19th. Yeah, that's next Monday. Gotta study real quick now...</p>
<p>On another note: my 22nd birthday is approaching. Not that's really interesting or something, but it's just that I don't know nice [little?] things to ask. Yeah, <a href="http://www.handspring.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml">one little thing here</a>, but I think 710 euro is a little to much asked :)</p>
