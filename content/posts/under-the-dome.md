I just finally finished [Under the Dome](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6320534-under-the-dome) by Stephen King. For several reasons it took me from last June till today to finish it; for one, I've been playing more games than in the ten years before combined (still not that much, but as my evenings are short, it eats into my downtime); also I read some graphic novels, did some Lego'ing and spent too much time at my computers.

Anyway, this is one of the longest stretches it took for me to read a book, so I will make sure to do better this year ^_^

Immediately started a new book by the way: [Permutation City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156784.Permutation_City) by Greg Egan.
