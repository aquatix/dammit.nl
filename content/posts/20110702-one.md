<p>This morning one year ago I was eating breakfast at my parents' place, anticipating seeing my bride for the first time in her beautiful dress. The day that followed was a whirlwind of really great moments and happenings, leading us to be married at a beautiful castle, then celebrating it with all people dear to us in a party that went on till about the next morning :)</p>

<p>This morning at least I was allowed to wake up laying aside my wife, but there will only a party for two today. Don't call if you need us, we're not here ;)</p>
