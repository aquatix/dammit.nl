<p>OK, I just updated the <a href="/overload/">live version of overload</a>. It now has a better support for UTF8, new artwork [shamelessly ripped from the default Gnome iconset], the option to add feeds [only works in the html version yet], search and read saved items [only in <acronym title="eXtensible User-interface Language">XUL</acronym> rich client yet].</p>

<p>Some things I want to implement yet: synchronize the html and rich client versions in functionality, add feed and userinfo management and have a <a href="http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews">river of news</a> mode in the rich client as the html version has [replacing the items listing with a larger view of the content]. The latter seems to be a mode in which I can scan headlines *and* content faster for interesting stuff then the default "e-mail" mode of the rich client.</p>

<p>Does anybody wants to do some input on this? I'm thinking about making some pseudo-categories too, consisting of "Todays items", "Random items" and user defined filters.</p>

<p>You can <a href="/overload/">find overload here</a>, there's also the <a href="/page/html/overload/">overload projectpage</a> and <a href="/bugs/">bugs can be filed here</a> or in a comment to this post. I'd like to have some feedback :)</p>
