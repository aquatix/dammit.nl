<p>For those following and/or using <a href="https://overload.aquariusoft.org/">the overload feedreader</a>: the reader has enclosure support now! Enclosures are references to files in the feed itself. Mostly used by "podcasts" etc, so you can download the audio file straight from the reader. Also, <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/">the Rocketboom videolog</a> uses it [right click, download .mov file], and even <a href="http://darkgate.net/comic/">The Dark Gate Comic Slurper</a> includes references to the comic image files it propagates.</p>
