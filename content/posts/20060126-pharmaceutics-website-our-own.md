<p>Yesterday I created <a href="/projects/apotheek/">a website for my girlfriends group of students pharmaceutical sciences</a>, which they gladly <a href="http://www.pharm.uu.nl/rijnstede/apodeuithof/">put online</a>. Now she's learning HTML and even CSS fast and building her very own new pages. You can say I'm a bit proud :)</p>

<p>Gotta love how you can whip up a nice website in about half an hour with some playing around with photographs and stylesheets.</p>
