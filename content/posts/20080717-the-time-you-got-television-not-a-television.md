<p>A VW van from the 50's of last century, advertising to get Television. That's right, not <em>a</em> television, or a dozen like a modern day US home has, but the concept in general. Times when the whole neighbourhood poured into your living room when a popular program was on. Wonder where those times have gone, as I barely watch television because of the generally crappy quality of the programs. Oh well, it's not like the Internet is much better ;)</p>
