<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570708,00.html">My So-Called Second Life - TIME</a></h3>
<p>Myeah, it's a lot of hype too. I decided against even trying because as this author notes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The growth of Second Life is particularly impressive considering that the program takes forever to download, requires a computer with a graphics card for gaming, sucks up hours just to design your character and-this is the genius part-has created the perfect capitalist system in which you pay for fake stuff (clothing, housing, hookers) with real money.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.debiantutorials.org/content/view/161/211/">Multimedia on your bad-ass Debian Etch Desktop - debiantutorials.org</a></h3>

<p>Just a random story of a windows user really liking his switch to Debian [Etch]</p>
<h3><a href="http://bloom.co.uk/improve_your_wifi_signal_faster_more_reliable_more_secure">Improve your WiFi signal (Faster, more reliable, more secure)</a></h3>

<h3><a href="http://users.aol.com/s6sj7gt/mike666.htm">The Number of the Beast</a></h3>

<h3><a href="http://www.stgraber.org/2007/05/20/gbtsco-already-release-02/">Bluetooth headset manager for linux</a></h3>
<p>Nice to see progress in getting those kind of things easier to set up</p>
<h3><a href="http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&amp;m=118296441702631">Intel Core 2 bugs</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>These processors are buggy as hell, and some of these bugs don't just
cause development/debugging problems, but will *ASSUREDLY* be
exploitable from userland code.</p>
<p>Note that some errata like AI65, AI79, AI43, AI39, AI90, AI99 scare
the hell out of us.  Some of these are things that cannot be fixed in
running code, and some are things that every operating system will do
until about mid-2008, because that is how the MMU has always been
managed on all generations of Intel/AMD/whoeverelse hardware.  Now
Intel is telling people to manage the MMU's TLB flushes in a new and
different way.  Yet even if we do so, some of the errata listed are
unaffected by doing so.</p>

<p>Read the whole email to get the entire picture. Surely scares me too...</p>
