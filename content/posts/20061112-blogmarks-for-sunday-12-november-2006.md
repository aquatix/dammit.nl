<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/08/creative_commons_boa.html">Creative Commons board-member's literary mystery novel</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Jamie Boyle, copyfightin' law professor who sits on Creative Commons's Board, has just published a fun literary mystery about the true authorship of Shakespeare's works.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds fun</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/09/why_zune_shouldnt_pa.html">Boing Boing: Why Zune shouldn't pay blood money to Universal</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>... a devastating critique of just why Universal & Microsoft's new agreement for profit sharing on Zune hardware sales is bad for music and a dangerous precedent.</p>

<ol>
<li>Instead of license fees covering music, theyâ€™ll cover audio hardware â€” with no music involved</li>
<li>Instead of license fees being paid to the musicians, theyâ€™ll be paid to the record label. One (large, corporate) label</li>
<li>Instead of a fair, standard license fee, that license fee will be negotiated independently by individual labels. Arbitrarily</li>
<li>Hardware manufacturers, who theoretically ought to profit off a product they design, manufacture, market, and distribute, will now have to share those profits with a separate company that wasnâ€™t involved in the hardware at all</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>All in all, not good...</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/02/dhs_incompetence_vir.html">DHS incompetence + virus = meltdown</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>... an excellent investigative piece on the Department of Homeland Security's meltdown in the face of the Zotob virus, which crashed and compromised the ill-starred "US-VISIT" program. [...] When they cracked loose the "sensitive" documents, it turned out that DHS officials had been protecting the "secret" of their incompetent response to the attack, not any technical details on the program.</p></blockquote>
