<p>First of all [text borrowed from <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian.org</a>]: protest against <a href="http://webshop.ffii.org/">software patents</a> in Europe.</p>
<p>Most software will become <a
href="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/index.en.html">illegal
to use in Europe</a> if this dangerous directive is adopted without
proper amending. The <a
href="http://swpat.ffii.org/players/bolkestein/index.en.html">Commission</a>
and the <a
href="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/index.en.html">Council
of Ministers</a> are <em>covertly</em> pushing for <em>unlimited</em>
patentability of software, heavily lobbied by multinationals and
patent lawyers. They are ignoring the <a href="http://www3.europarl.eu.int/omk/omnsapir.so/pv2?PRG=CALDOC&amp;FILE=20030924&amp;LANGUE=EN&amp;TPV=DEF&amp;LASTCHAP=31&amp;SDOCTA=2&amp;TXTLST=2&amp;Type_Doc=ANNEX&amp;POS=1">democratically
voted decision</a> of the European Parliament from 24 september 2003, which has the support of more than <a href="http://petition.eurolinux.org">300.000 citizens</a>, <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/ceapme0309/index.en.html">2.000.000
<acronym title="Small and Medium-sized Enterprise">SME</acronym>s</a>, dozens of <a href="http://www.researchineurope.org/policy/patentdirltr.htm">economists</a> and <a
href="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/komp0305/index.en.html">scientists</a>.</p>

<p>So now I'm participating in the online demonstration [not going to close my website for those 10 days though, you wish :)]. Get on with the news =)</p>

<p>Went to the <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/">university</a> today, doing some homework. Then went to cash a birthday present my girlfriend gave me [2.5 month ago :P]: a massage by a professional. Man I'm relaxed now =) This is going to be another hobby ;)</p>
<p>As you've read in my previous post, I have "fixed" a Dell laptop by reinstalling winxp on it [the current install was totally b0rked]. The owner got it crushed on a plane trip, so <a href="/images/screenies/p4142371_scaled.jpg">bye bye nice screen</a>. Ah well, the guy is happy with it now [is going to replace the screen - luckily for that poor thing]. I still wonder how <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix Lightgui</a> would have run on that high-res tft screen =)</p>
<p>On a sidenote: I'm wondering why my laptop's running so slow when under high load. It used to remain smooth, but now it almost locks up :|</p>
<p>Humm, maybe I should finish my homework assignments now...</p>
