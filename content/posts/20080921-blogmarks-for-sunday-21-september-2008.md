<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/feature-vending-machine-delivers-freshly-cooked-pizzas-in-90-seconds">Vending Machine Delivers Freshly Cooked Pizzas in 90-Seconds</a></h3>
<p>Now that's kinda cool. I guess it stretches the concept of "fresh" a bit though; I wonder how they complete it in 90 seconds - maybe some high-powered toaster-like device or something</p>
<h3><a href="http://likuidkewl.blogspot.com/2008/08/some-xubuntu-xfce-tweaks.html">Some Xubuntu / xfce4 tweaks</a></h3>
<p>Especially interesting is the one to remove the "super" function from the windows key, so you can bind it in Keyboard settings - Shortcuts to show the xfce4 menu. This wouldn't work otherwise, as it would act as a modifier, needing another key to combine with.</p>

<p>To your ~/.Xmodmap file add:</p>
<pre>
remove mod4 = Super_L

<p>Awesome vintage looking pictures</p>
<h3><a href="http://printeresting.org/2008/09/17/ghost-of-a-printing-press/">Ghost of a Printing Press</a></h3>
<p>Beautiful picture of the place where a colour printing press used to stand. Also check <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/09/18/beautiful-toner-expl.html">this beautiful toner explosion</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.deepamehta.de/">DeepaMehta</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>DeepaMehta is a software platform for <a href="http://www.deepamehta.de/docs/km.html">Knowledge&nbsp;Management</a>. Knowledge is represented in a semantic network and is handled collaboratively. DeepaMehta combines <a href="http://www.deepamehta.de/docs/research.html">interdisciplinary research</a> with the idea of <a href="http://www.deepamehta.de/docs/opensource.html">Open&nbsp;Source</a> to generate a <a href="http://www.deepamehta.de/docs/benefit.html">true benefit</a> for workflow as well as for social processes. At the same time Deepa Mehta is an indian movie director.</p></blockquote>

<p>Semantic knowledge representation. Interesting for braindumps and such.</p>

<blockquote><p>What is the most flexible, intelligent, interactive data retrieval system yet to appear?</p>
<p>It's the book.</p></blockquote>

<p>They make an interesting point with this article, but skip a bit on the ease of a search-function and hyperlinks possible in an e-book. If you have a decent e-book reader, meaning it will display content (be it text or images) in a high resolution (the screen of the Nokia N810 starts coming close), transflective or reflective screen (causing great contrast which eases reading, like e-paper), this may just rival a paper edition of a book. Also, this enables you to take a whole series with you, which is a lot easier to use as reference when on a trip than a backpack full of hefty paper.</p>

<h3><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7613575.stm">Saudi judge condemns 'immoral TV'</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The most senior judge in Saudi Arabia has said it is permissible to kill the owners of satellite TV channels which broadcast immoral programmes.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Given his position as the country's most senior judge, the sheikh's views can not be easily dismissed, says BBC Arab affairs analyst, Magdi Abdelhadi.</p>
<p>Clerics like Sheikh al-Luhaydan represent a huge dilemma for the Saudi royal family, our correspondent adds.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Saudi rulers need their support to claim that they rule in the name of Islam.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, fighting militant Islam can be difficult when the country's top judge calls for the beheading of those he views as immoral broadcasters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Always fun when influential people start saying things like that. Makes it even harder to govern a country that way.</p>
