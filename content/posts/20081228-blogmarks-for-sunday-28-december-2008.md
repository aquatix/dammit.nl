<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/brand_new_best_worst_2008.php">Brand New: Best &amp; Worst 2008 </a></h3>
<p>Best and worst logo changes of the past year. There are some fine ones and some damn stupid/ugly ones (seriously, Pepsi, what's up with that?)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.veoh.com/videos/v16745488GpXEWg2Q">Printing 1947</a></h3>
<p>Great look into the past of printing: printing like they did it in 1947</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.colino.net/wordpress/archives/2008/11/26/organizing-core-dumps/">Organizing core dumps</a></h3>
<p>Handy tip how to organise all core dumps into one central dir</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU8DDYz68kM">Battle at Kruger</a></h3>
<p>Wow, that's one hell of a nature movie; buffalo's come across lions, lions attack calf and then the interesting part begins. Watch it through, this is a nature movie worth watching :)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.weebls-stuff.com/testy/adventcalendar.html">Weebl Advent Calendar</a></h3>
<p>Too much holiday-season sillyness on one calendar. Some are rather silly, but there are a few awesome ones in there (a very catchy one is <a href="http://www.weebls-stuff.com/testy/AdventCalendar/day8.html">this Santas track</a> and <a href="http://www.weebls-stuff.com/testy/AdventCalendar/day20.html">this happy Santa song</a>). <a href="http://www.weebls-stuff.com/testy/AdventCalendar/day19.html">A very funny one about Lapland (imho) is also one you should see</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.camerapedia.org/wiki/Konica_C35_Automatic">Konica C35</a></h3>
<p>The first photo camera I knew, the one my dad used back in the days. He still has it, including the external flash. Good times</p>
