Interesting research to the Fermi Paradox and how fast settlement of our Galaxy can be done in various scenario's. Also, animations!

> The simulation shows a significant fraction of a galaxy can be settled in a relatively short period of time, even with ships traveling no faster than the Voyager spacecraft. Further, the center of the galaxy could be a cosmic cantina that’d make even George Lucas blush.
