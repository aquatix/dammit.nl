<p>... you can see things far more brilliant. This thought occurred to me while walking back home after parking our car in the garage, looking up to a windy but clear sky. I spended this afternoon with my girlfriend, continuing a nice weekend that started Friday after my last classes.</p>
<p>Friday I brought my laptop to the university so we could play some serious games :) Arcade games on mame more precisely. I somehow won too one time :)</p>
<p>After that came a Saturday that I spended at my work for the best part. But after that, I had diner with my friends Harry, Vanessa and Stijn at the place of the mom of Vanessa. That meant: Indonesean food. And it was good :) When finished eating we headed for my bosses' new place because he was both celebrating his birthday and keeping a housewarming party. Well, that party was beyond my expectations. Very enjoyable, interesting conversations. I got quite drunk too ;) [Jack Daniels black label and me are a good pair ;)]</p>
<p>So after sleeping quite some time and a reviving hot shower I went to my girlfriends place [thankfull to be able to borrow my parents' car because of the - still - nasty weather]. We had a good time and eated Boeuf Bourgondique, a Belgian dish.</p>
<p>Coming home I looked at the moonlit sky, stars almost everywhere dispite the glare of the lanterns. A very nice view. When I wanted to share this with you, I discovered to backlight of my laptops screen somehow wasn't working. Did my baby let me down after three years? After shutting it down and shaking it a little [pushing the case at some places] I switched it on again and now it did lit up. Phew... But still weird :/</p>
<p>I'm not that concerned about it and am glad to have enjoyed this weekend. I kinda feel revived after the weird week before. But I'm off to my bed now, otherwise that fresh feeling wears of way too fast ;)</p>
