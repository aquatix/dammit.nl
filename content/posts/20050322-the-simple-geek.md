<p>OK, time for a new quiz: The True Geek Test. Result? The Simple Geek</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quote">You answered 74% of the questions as a geek truly would.</p>
<p class="quote">You don't seem to sway in either direction, however you still seem to
have some latent geek attributes within you. Maybe you're interested in
computers but not a gamer? Maybe you've got geek hobbies but none of
the awkward social tendencies. You may be slightly geekier than you
thought and in denial!</p>
<p class="quote">The simple geek usually has various quirks that friends may make
fun of, but in general can be considered a fairly normal person. Your
geek attributes make you less likely to conform to society. The popular
kids don't hate you but the geeks don't either, so it's a respectable
demographic.</p>

<p class="quote"><em>In a nutshell, you answered enough questions with geek tendencies
and enough questions without geek tendencies that it's difficult to
pinpoint your exact alignment.</em></p>

<p class="quote">You scored higher than <em>53%</em> on geekness</p>
