<p>Sooo, since 2008-04-02 I've gotten about 11487 spam messages on <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/photolog/">my photolog</a> (which really isn't used all that much; only 57 posts and 2 actual comments), while I have disabled 95 comments on this weblog which is used quite extensively (at least to my standards) with 790 posts and 366 normal comments. This means that on this self written weblog I got 0.12 spams per post, while on the photolog running wordpress I get 201.53 spams per post. Interesting.</p>
