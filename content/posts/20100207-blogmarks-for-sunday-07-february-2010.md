<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-easily-share-your-wireless-connection-in-ubuntu-9-10/">How To Easily Share Your Wireless Connection in Ubuntu 9.10</a></h3>
<p>Epic win</p>
<h3><a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/02/getting-over-the-barriers-to-wiki-adoption.ars">Getting over the barriers to wiki adoption</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>What follows is usually an excuse for why the speaker feels that a wiki isn't a worthwhile tool for collaboration in his or her environment. I use the word "excuse" deliberately, because rarely does anyone articulate an actual business reason, such as a lack of need. When I ask deeper questions, I invariably find that the objection isn't to the wiki technology itself, but instead to the concept of collaborative authoring and a perceived loss of control over the content.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/30/change-your-life-friends-popular">This column will change your life: Why Your Friends Have More Friends Than You Do</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Ever wondered why your friends seem so much more popular than you are? There's a reason for that.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.scottkelby.com/blog/2010/archives/8310">Why is Everybody So Angry about Apple's iPad?</a></h3>
<p>About sums it up. It will be great for quite a lot of people, and won't be "the thing" for users that want more control. I really only hope that it won't be the beginning of closing down *all* computers, as that will seriously hamper tinkerers. Tinkerers that are our future developers/hackers/programmers (think about how you started with IT).</p>
<h3><a href="http://zedshaw.com/essays/programmer_stats.html">Programmers Need To Learn Statistics Or I Will Kill Them All</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>I have a major pet peeve that I need to confess. I go insane when I hear
programmers talking about statistics like they know shit when it&#8217;s clearly
obvious they do not. I&#8217;ve been studying it for years and years and <strong>still</strong> don&#8217;t think I know anything.  This article is my call for all
programmers to finally learn enough about statistics to at least know <strong>they don&#8217;t know shit.</strong> I have no idea why, but their confidence in their lacking 
knowledge is only surpassed by their lack of confidence in their personal
appearance.</p></blockquote>
