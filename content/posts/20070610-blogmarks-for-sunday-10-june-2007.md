<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap070603.html">APOD: 2007 June 3 - Shuttle Plume Shadow Points to Moon</a></h3>
<p>Really nice picture of the shadow of Atlantis' take-off smoke pointing towards the full moon.</p>
<h3><a href="http://vonmag.com/technology/um/im/presence/living-in-the-presence">Living in the Presence</a></h3>
<p>Being networked makes for nice possibilities in being connected and how things can be hooked up to each other</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.process-one.net/en/blogs/article/angie_introducing_flexarch/">[Process-one] Introducing FlexArch</a></h3>
<p>Interesting article about the distributed architecture behind ejabberd, a nice Jabber daemon, intended to be used by lots of clients</p>
<h3><a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/">HiRISE | High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment</a></h3>
<p>Really high resolution Mars pictures! As <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/science/07/06/04/1842258.shtml">the Slashdot article about it</a> says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The team that runs the high-rez camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has just released more than 1,200 Mars images to the <a href="http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/">Planetary Data System</a>, NASA's mission data archive. The team has also released 1.7 Terabytes of data to a <a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/">user-friendly site</a> that allows users to quickly home in on each image, most of which are a gigabyte-sized files measuring 20,000 by 50,000 pixels. Not all the images have been thoroughly studied yet: in the announcement, the camera's lead scientist said,  'These images must contain hundreds of important discoveries about Mars. We just need time to realize what they are.'</p></blockquote>

<p>So, maybe you can find interesting stuff even NASA didn't see yet :)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel/?page_id=12">Pixel image editor - Cheap Photoshop alternative</a></h3>
<p>Interesting piece of software, running on quite a bunch of different platforms. You can even buy it through some Dutch shop</p>
<h3><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Fow7iUaKrq4">[YouTube] Monzy performs at Stanford Univ.: kill -9</a></h3>
<p>Erm... a rap song about kill -9</p>
<h3><a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004561.html">Something is ___ in Denmark</a></h3>
<p>Bwhahaha :)</p>

<p>And to think lots of people have difficulties with English ;)</p>
<h3><a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004563.html">Amplifying "faint signals" from the alpha geeks who are creating the future</a></h3>
<p>O'RLY?</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trevi55/296804891/">Ubuntu Untrusted Repository </a></h3>
<p>Don't just trust a random repository; let alone <a href="http://soijabanaani.net/tmp/the_trevino_story">a whole list of them</a>!</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.robweir.com/blog/2007/05/interoperability-by-design.html">Interoperability by Design</a></h3>
<p>About the "great" ODF plugin for Microsoft Office 2007; it doesn't even enable you to use ODF files, but only import/export them. When you create a new file and want to save it as ODF, you even need to save it to a temporary .doc or whatever first...</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.robweir.com/blog/2007/05/so-where-are-all-ooxml-documents.html">An Antic Disposition: So where are all the OOXML documents?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Google has a nice feature that allows you to search for documents that match a given file type. This is done by adding "filetype:NNN" to your query, where NNN corresponds to the file type. This feature has supported the ODF and OOXML document formats for at least two months, when I first noticed it. I've been tracking some numbers since then and now have enough data to make some observations.</p>

<p>So with all this evident love for Microsoft Office 2007, why is it that 6-months later there are only 63 OOXML spreadsheet documents on the web, something like 0.3% of the number of ODF spreadsheet documents? How can there be 300 companies supporting OOXML and only have 69 OOXML presentations on the web?</p></blockquote>

<p>Interesting...</p>
