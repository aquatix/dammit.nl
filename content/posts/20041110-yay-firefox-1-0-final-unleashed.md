<p>OK, going along with the hype, I want to make sure nobody misses this release :) <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Get Firefox now!</a>. It's final, it's cool and it's <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/archives/2004/11/firefox">not yet translated neatly into Dutch</a>. But it's coming along [dutchies, you don't really want words like "webstek" in a program do you? Come on...]. Also for the dutchies: <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/nl/">De Nederlandse Mozilla site</a>. Now if only <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> is translated into Dutch, I'll be able to convert even more people to those great programs.</p>
