<p>Let me put first that I don't really care who is going to win the elections tomorrow in the US of A, as long as it isn't Bush. I was watching <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/">this neat map</a> now and then, just for the fun of it [although the amount of red is a bit worrying], but now <a href="http://politics.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/01/152256&amp;tid=226&amp;tid=95">it's become known</a> that the former anonymous Votemaster is <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/">Andy Tanenbaum</a>, one of my professors, and a famous <acronym title="Computer Science">CS</acronym> writer [those books are full of info, but he manages to keep them readable to the point of enjoyable; thumbs up for that]. Read more about this on his <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/info/votemaster-faq.html">Votemaster FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't expect him to run such a [quite] high profile political website, but it fits him quite well, knowing his strong views and such. Maybe I shouldn't aspire doing my Master thesis in his research group ;)</p>
