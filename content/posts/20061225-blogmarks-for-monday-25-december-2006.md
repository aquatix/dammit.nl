<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/human-nature/">Human nature</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>I watched one of the Morgan Spurlock's 30 Days documentaries, which involved an atheist woman (Brenda) staying for 30 days with a devoutly Christian couple (Michael and Tracy). Actually, it was pretty interesting for the most part. The Christian couple were intelligent and reasonably open-minded [...] When Brendaâ€™s husband and children came to visit her, Tracy commented - with palpable shock and surprise - that Brenda seemed to really love her children and be a good mother.</p>
<p>What did she expect? Did she think that atheists neglect and beat their children and feed them crack? Did she think that without a belief in God, people must be immoral? Other conversations with people in Michael and Tracy's church revealed that this was quite a common belief. I find that frightening and sad. Frightening for obvious reasons, but sad because it implies that people like Michael and Tracy are infantilized. It seems that they believe they need a higher power (or his representatives in the form of the clergy) to tell them how to behave properly, and that if they did not have this, they might behave badly.</p>

<p>Sad indeed; religion can be a good thing: giving hope in hard times, providing moral guidlines etc. However, grown people should be able to cope with day-to-day things without having some higher guide to hold their hands...</p>

<blockquote><p>I have recently discovered a treasure trove of Documentaries on Google. No, not Documentary clips, but full length quality Docus. If I may bring your attention to two of my absolute favorites.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://specialreports.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/12/08/1929225">Configuration: the forgotten side of security</a></h3>
<p>Because, when you start out with a securely set-up machine, there are already a lot less things that can go wrong [the attack vector becomes a lot smaller]. Do you really need that web service enabled? Did you switch off remote logging in for root? Et cetera.</p>

<h3><a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/52074#786647">How long in the freezer to chill a Coke from 89F to 35F?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>That would be about 20-25 minutes in a freezer. If you put it in a bucket of ice, that would halve that time. If you put water in that ice, it'd be cold (+- 5c) enough to drink in about 4-6 minutes, if you put salt in that water, you'd reduce the chill time to just over 2 minutes. Agitating the can in the water, rolling it around, reduces the chill time even more.</p>

<p>The fastest possible way is to grab a CO2 fire extinguisher and unload that sucker on the can.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, do NOT bury the can in sand, pour gasoline on the sand and set the sand on fire. That won't do anything.</p>

<p>This is all empirically gained evidence, not third party.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh btw, 89F and 35F is 31.67C and 1.67C respectively</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/14/myspace_users_have_s.html">MySpace users have stronger passwords than corporate users</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Bruce Schneier analyzes the data from a successful phishing attack on MySpace and compares the captured user-passwords to an earlier data-set from a corporation and concludes that MySpace users are better at coming up with good passwords than corporate drones. The article is a great state-of-the-password address, with lots of fun nuggets like "We used to quip that 'password' is the most common password. Now it's 'password1.' Who said users haven't learned anything about security?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Aight! Internet is a fun place...</p>
