<p>I'm about to throw a little party at our place for which I invited a lot of family and friends. Some of those people unfortunately suffer from the flu or busy agendas and had to invite themselves another evening, but it seems we will still have quite a lot of visitors to stuff into our not-that-huge living room. It will be... interesting, fun and cosy :)</p>

<p>Oh, for those wondering, I've turned 0x1B today. Technically I'm still a teenager ;)</p>
