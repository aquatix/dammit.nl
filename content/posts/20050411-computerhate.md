<p>You'd almost think I've got the wrong hobbies, because today I hate computers. Or at least I hate failing hardware. I guess everybody hates it, but today it's my turn. I've been spending the better part of the afternoon trying to backup data. Two DVD's succeeded. That's by far not the amount I intended to burn. I'll return to my parents place tomorrow I guess. *sigh*</p>

<p>My dad's windows pc wouldn't cooperate either, as it was acting with windows' little will of it's own and slowing to a crawl when trying to burn a significant amount of data, transferring stuff across the network. All in all no great fun, so it was only good to be able to spend some time having a coffee in the sun in the garden with my parents.</p>

<p>Back to my project.</p>
