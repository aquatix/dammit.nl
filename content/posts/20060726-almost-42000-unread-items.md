<p>... in my <a href="https://overload.aquariusoft.org/">newsfeed reader</a>. I guess I should start using it again ;) Frankly, I want to start building that new <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>-based version, so I can implement smart filters based on tags. The current way is just too messy. Anybody has some more smart ideas?</p>

<p>The cause of me still not having a working prototype, is that I want to finish my Bachelorproject first, so I can finally start wrapping up my Bachelor in Computer Science, and finishing up my Master after. Also, a project from work keeps haunting me, and they don't have someone to take over on the really short notice...</p>
