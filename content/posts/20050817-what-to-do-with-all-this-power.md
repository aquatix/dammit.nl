<p>A small follow-up on <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=308">my previous post about my mediacenter project</a> to get an overview for myself and anybody interested.</p>

<p>OK, so now I [almost] have a quiet Shuttle mediacenter with 3GHz Pentium4, 1GiB PC3200 DDR RAM memory, a Maxtor 250GiB harddisk drive with 16MiB cache, a NEC 3540A DVD +/- rewriter and a cool Hauppauge PVR350 TV card with MPEG2 encoder/decoder chip and remote control. After all this technobabble, what the hell am I going to spend all this power on?</p>

<p>First, it's going to act as a VCR on steroids of course. Check the <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV site</a>, and <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/modules.php?name=MythFeatures">especially the screenies/features page</a> for more on that. Featuring an electronic programming guide [hopefully for the Netherlands too], video editing [removing commercials ;)] and lots more. It can show DVDs, movies and music on the hdd, looking up meta information about it, rip those movies and music _to_ hdd [for the lazy people among us], it shows news headlines [including RSS feeds, yay!], your local weather, pictures in a slideshow, and -- last but not least -- you can play games on it, as it has an emulator frontend [MAME, NES, SNES and generic PC games]!</p>

<p>Yeah, and those are only the features of MythTV. Of course I will try to make Firefox and Thunderbird work at the low TV resolution for some quick checking. Furthermore, it's going to serve as my new server.</p>

<p>That will include the Apache webserver [including mod_python for <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">the Django Python framework</a> I think], a mailserver [can't live without it anymore] and shellserver [ofcourse]. I'll finally have some room and horsepower to build some livecds again too. As my parents are going to change internet provider, and are a bit bored having my current server xcalibur making noice in their computer room, I'm going to move all services from xcalibur to this yet-to-be-named server. Then I can cannibalize xcalibur for upgrades to my current workstation, as an Athlon XP 1800+ is somewhat faster then my current AMD Duron 750MHz ;)</p>
