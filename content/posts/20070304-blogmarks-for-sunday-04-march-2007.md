<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://buranen.info/?p=77">"Oh Dell, why must you disappoint me so?" or "Why I won't buy Dell right now"</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Dell's computer with no operating system is $53 more expensive than one loaded with Vista!</p>
<p>[...] I can see Microsoft using this to say that no one buys Linux PCs when theyâ€™re available. Again, crap! I'm going to go out on a limb and say that anyone looking to get Linux on a PC is smart enough to know that you can erase windows. And at $53 dollars more, where is the advantage of buying a PC without it?</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.galaxycow.com/blogs/vermyndax/2007/01/29/the-upgrade-version/">Vista, The Upgrade Version</a></h3>
<p>This post has been lying in my RSS reader for a while for me to post about, but I'll just blogmark it.</p>

<blockquote><p>You cannot install Windows Vista without Windows 2000 or XP already installed on the system.  This bucks the previous process of installing Windows from scratch, but proving you own the prior version by inserting the disc for verification.</p>

<p>[...]One item you might want to be aware of though - when reading the Vista EULA... once you install the Vista upgrade, the Vista rights/EULA completely supersedes all licensing agreements for the previous version. This means you essentially lose your rights to even install the prior version of Windows ever again.</p>

<p>Hope that Vista upgrade goes well for you - because if your computer ganks up (which, it will), you're breaking the law by reinstalling Windows XP to upgrade back to Vista.</p></blockquote>

<p>So far for trying out that expensive, shiny [?] new operating system you just might have bought yourself or $relative. It ganks up your install? Too bad, you can't reinstall your old XP or 2k system, and without that, you can't upgrade. A problem? <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Maybe</a> <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">not</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://security.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/02/13/1637251">Note to new Linux users: No antivirus needed</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>One of the most common questions I hear new Linux users ask is "What program should I use for virus protection?" Many of them lose faith in me as a source of security information when I reply, "None." But you really don't need to fear malware on your new platform, thanks to the way Linux is built.</p></blockquote>

<p>The only podium in our vicinity where you could go out and listen some good live music for a good price [in contrast to the trash you hear in $RANDOM_PUB] is going to be gone in under two months, thanks to our city stopping the money flow to the volunteers. Geez, thanks...</p>
