There's this Martin Molin guy that is a wonderful nerdy musician. He build the original [Marble Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q) and has been building a [Marble Machine X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI2Q5cFqx9k) ever since.

His channel is a really nice documentary of the process and progress of this project, and provides a lot of detail of the work he puts into machining the parts by hand and computer-aided systems. I think he's a genius, funny guy, and a good musician, all rolled into one.
