<p>BTW, I just found out dammIT went 6 months old last Sunday :) It's <a href="index.php?rantid=4">first real entry</a> is written at 2003-12-20, while it <a href="index.php?rantid=5">came online at 2003-12-21</a>. So whatever way you look at it, it's officially half a year old now.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, which happenes to have <a href="/~jakerockwell/">a website on this server</a> too, is a guy with too much free time, and created an ascii art picture of my watch. It's quite appropriate on this post, so I'll make him happy :) :</p>
