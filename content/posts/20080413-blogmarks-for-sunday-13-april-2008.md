<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBDBRg3HJqA">Optimus Maximus: at long last, we bring one home to test!</a></h3>
<p>Really interesting to see how you could change the layout so easily with the software. This device has quite some potential. Not sure how much *need* I'll have for one, but it's darn cool :) Also see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svjLIZKAHQI">this quick overview</a> of the keyboard [with various modes and status messages and the smaller 3-key edition]</p>
<h3><a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080411-vistas-uac-security-prompt-was-designed-to-annoy-you.html">Vista's UAC security prompt was designed to annoy you</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>At the RSA 2008 confab in San Francisco, Microsoft admitted that UAC was designed, in fact, to annoy. Microsoft's David Cross came out and said so: "The reason we put UAC into the platform was to annoy users. I'm serious," said Cross.</p>

<p>This isn't a total revelation. UAC was designed to get in your face; it's all about that "hey, you sure about that bauddy?", second-guessing thing. It's a less intimidating, less entertaining version of Clint Eastwood saying, "do you feel lucky, punk?" All this because you wanted to do something unimpressive like view all running processes on your system or install GAIM.</p>

<p>What makes UAC annoying is that it's a half-breed of sorts. UAC is not a security barrier, which is one of the reasons why users hate it: they don't see the point in a process elevation alert box that asks you to click "OK," as opposed to inputting a password when you're an admin.</p></blockquote>

<p>They made it annoying to encourage developers to make their programs and installers less intrusive, but in the process totally ruining the user experience. Way to go for a "security measurement".</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_2809172.html?menu=news.quirkies">Cabinet for girl who wanted 'Cab, init?'</a></h3>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, if you are asking for something like that, you should speak clearly and not append words possibly altering the meaning, or use some slang on an official service. It might not help you at all ;)</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/04/msg00286.html">Announcing Dolt, a drop-in Libtool replacement which cuts build times in half</a></h3>
<p>Nice!</p>
<h3><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7330355.stm">India's 'sensory assault course'</a></h3>
<p>Or, how the Indian bazars with their  choice, sensory attack and service are a much nicer alternative to the western-styled supermarkets trying to get a foothold in that country</p>
