It's over half a year ago that I switched jobs, coming from a big media company and now leading a new, young team at basically a startup. It switched me on again, giving me an energy for work stuff I had not felt for a while somehow, and made me feel a bit more alive (!) in a manner.

The flipside is that after about half a year almost single-handedly setting up a lot of systems and infrastructure, rewriting and writing a lot of functionality for our main product, and coaching my new team members, I kind of need a break :) Luckily, our vacation time is nearing, and some critical deadlines are now behind us, so hopefully the next few months will have a less breakneck speed, and I can focus on stabilising functionality, removing some oddities and fixing some quirks that have been bothering us for a lot of time.
