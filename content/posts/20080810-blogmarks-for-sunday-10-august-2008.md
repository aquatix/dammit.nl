<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>

<p>I might even go with option d) "all of the above"; why even pay her bills yet? Pay for your own phone, and if you manage to get such a bill still [despite knowing you're the one who's paying for it], a spanking may be in order :)</p>

<blockquote><p>This is how the doctor remembers it:<br />
"We called their help line, and got a wonderful young man in the Philippines who told us:<br />
" 'We can't install it because your name has - in it.' "<br />
I asked the doctor how I was going to print that. He said, "Just say it's a word contained in Libshitz."</p></blockquote>
