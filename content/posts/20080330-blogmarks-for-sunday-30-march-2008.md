<h3><a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2008/03/06/i_dont_multitask.html">I Don't Multitask</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t multitask. Think about it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_vase" title="Rubin vase - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">you can&#8217;t concentrate on two things at once</a>. Yes, to the outsider, I am doing many tasks at once, but in my head I can only do one thing at a time. Where the art is, where the skill is, and what the term should describe is what I do between the tasks. What I do well is a combination of timely, adept context switches combined with content-rich breaks.</p></blockquote>

<p>Multitasking is something you can or cannot do. However, most people [like me] will only be able to do one thing at a time, but might be able to switch fast and easily between tasks and still concentrate fully on each of them, achieving some semi-multitasking</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/25/free-downloadable-sf.html">Free downloadable sf novel: GREY, "high-fashion dystopia"</a></h3>
<p>Dystopian stories remain fascinating. In contrast to a utopian future, they depict a future where everything is not so happy, free and careless like we would like it to.</p>

<blockquote><p>Nora and I finished our fried whale and plum sandwiches, our cream coffees, and the cocoa and coca pastries, and sat in a comfortable silence as landscapes of buildings and millions of well-wishers whirred past the windows at six hundred kilometers per hour. Halfway on our train-date, after the conductor blew the massive, buzzing horn, and the waitresses in their black-and-yellow-striped honeybee uniforms, complete with dangerously sharp-looking stingers, cleared the dishes, Nora closed her right eye and gazed at me with her left; I, in turn, did the same, and it was like we were the perfect couple.</p>

<p>This was our fourth and last date before our marriage, and while the whole thing had been arranged between our parents to complete the merger of our familiesâ€™ companies, I could not have imagined or wished for someone as wonderful as she. Standing just an inch below my six foot three, with shiny black hair, a light walnut complexion, and obsidian eyes, her features were wide and open like an innocent doll, but she was also intelligent and witty. Most impressive of all was that she, like myself, loved the fashion magazine Pure H. We quoted from it, dressed and struck poses like the models, and felt that we were just like the beautiful and tragic people of our dreams.</p></blockquote>

<p>I loved those stories as a child, reading the comic books and watching the animated movies. Now there's a musical starring Kuifje [the Dutch name of his hair lock], and I think there's even a movie in the pipe line. Let's hope they are an ode to one of the more important people in the comic scene</p>
<h3><a href="http://gizmodo.com/368651/new-video-of-bigdog-quadruped-robot-is-so-stunning-its-spooky">Weird: New Video of BigDog Quadruped Robot Is So Stunning It's Spooky</a></h3>
<p>Nice, robotics is coming along slowly, but steadily, and this bot is animal-like in its behaviour. It manages to walk with a large load over difficult ground. Impressive</p>

<p>Our new public transports chip card is a fiasco, as companies and government haven't thought about security and openness good enough. Basing encryption and security on open standards is a good way of having a nicely debugged system, as a lot of people have thought about it and scrutenised it for faults</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.kismith.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2008/03/21/maybelater/">Managing 'todo' lists - MaybeLater</a></h3>
<p>Meh, I was planning on creating something really similar in Django too. Maybe I still will, as <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/html/overload/">overload</a> deserves a revival and a new life as information manager</p>
<h3><a href="http://trac.phidev.info/trac/wiki/AptZeroconf">AptZeroconf</a></h3>
<p>Apt-Zeroconf uses auto-discovery of other similarly-configured clients on your network and pulls packages from their package cache instead of downloading from a mirror, saving you a lot of bandwidth. For those too lazy to install Squid or apt-proxy :)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.cabel.name/2008/02/fancyzoom-10.html">FancyZoom 1.1</a></h3>
<p>Nice zooming widget for images on your website</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.chipx86.com/blog/?p=244">Django Development with Djblets</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Djblet's feature list currently consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication improvements, making it easy to register and login in one step, seamlessly, handle password recovery, and more.</li>
<li>Flexible datagrids for displaying data in a paginated list with user-specific column customization, ordering and sorting.</li>
<li>Decorators to drastically simplify creation of simple and block template tags.</li>
<li>Caching functions for calling a function and caching the result if the data isn&#8217;t already in the cache, and a special URL pattern matcher that prevents caching of any contained URLs.</li>
<li>Unit testing utility classes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds useful when developing in Django [Python framework]. See also part 2, <a href="http://www.chipx86.com/blog/?p=245">Django Development with Djblets: Custom Tag Helpers</a>.</p>
