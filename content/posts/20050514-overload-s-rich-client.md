<p>As I said in my <a href="./index.php?rantid=269">previous post</a>, I have been working on <a href="/page/html/overload/">project overload</a> today. There's a <a href="/overload/">new version online</a>. Be sure to check the Rich client [see topnav], as that's where the work of today has gone into.</p>

<p>Suggestions and bugs can be posted here, or <a href="/bugs/">in the bugtracker</a> [under "overload feedreader" ofcourse].</p>
