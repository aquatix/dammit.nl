<p>Soooo, it appears there was some small programming error which broke sessions in my self-written weblog software. This kinda blocked me from posting here. Combined with a rather busy life and me <a href="http://twitter.com/michielscholten">twittering small blurps</a> instead of writing larger posts this led to dammIT be really neglected.</p>

<p>I plan on reviving this weblog. I will likely stop posting those blogmarks, which will stop the 'pollution' of the archive with lots of wrap-up links-this-week postings. This is still my platform of choice for writing larger pieces on Life, the Universe and Everything, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Oh by the way, be sure to check out the 2D style refresh I did here ;)</p>
