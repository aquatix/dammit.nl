<p>OK... I get quite a lot of comment spam on a single posting I did more than a month ago; until I figure out how to stop it [I want to implement "Comments closed for this posting", but I'm looking for a way of preventing it], comments are disabled :( If you have a good idea of preventing spam on a weblog [and on a guestbook, as I'm receiving a lot of spam in one I maintain for a sports club], please mail me at <em>aquatix at gmail dot com</em>. I'll share them here, if appropriate.</p>
