<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7610534.stm">Japan tops world broadband study</a></h3>
<p>And to think a few years ago, most internet access was done through mobile phones in Japan (and maybe still is). In Europe, the Netherlands take a comfortable second place behind Sweden. Now where stays the 100MBit/gigabit fiber to my home, with a nice ethernet box in the closet?</p>
<h3><a href="http://bedposted.com/">Bedpost - Ever wonder how often you get busy?</a></h3>
<p>People on IRC tend to paste weird links. This one is one of them; why would you want to post info/stats on the special-quality time you spend with your partner and even during the act? Might be interesting for women devouring students or something...</p>

<blockquote><p>The main kicker of the news piece is this:<br />
12 percent of the districts 8th graders are proficient in reading.<br />
12%. Only 12%.<br />
