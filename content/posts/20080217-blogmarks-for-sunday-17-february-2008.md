<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.deepdarc.com/2008/02/14/mobile-xmpp/">Mobile XMPP and Google Android's choice for a binary proprietary format</a></h3>
<p>Informative article on why the choice of Google for changing away from XMPP [Jabber's protocol] to a GTalk, proprietary binary protocol might not be for the best.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'll enumerate the implications and conclusions:</p>

<ol>
<li>XMPP is verbose.</li>
<li>XMPP is inefficient for mobile networking.</li>
<li>A proprietary binary protocol would be more efficient for mobile devices.</li>
<li>The former Android <tt>xmppService</tt> API will diverge away from XMPP.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think that this direction is unfortunate, and the reasons misguided. Read on, and I'll elaborate...</p>
