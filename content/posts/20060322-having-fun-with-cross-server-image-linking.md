<p>I know lots of people don't have some webspace of their own. However, if they start posting on forums etc, they tend to want a nice picture with it. So they do a quick Google image search on it, paste the uri of the picture in their profile, and done. Results <a href="http://www.novosadski.net/viewtopic.php?p=51370&amp;sid=0a518389ede6dc7057c06d1278bd475b">here</a> and <a href="http://www.zone-wz.com/forums/viewtopic.php?id=20602">here</a>, for example. Mind the picture of the guy with the cup of coffee. I borrowed that picture from <a href="http://www.alextreme.org/drupal/?q=node/434">Alextreme's posting about the same problem</a>. In my case, they where linking to the small DeviantArt and Hacker emblem logos [both can be found in the bar at the right of this site], but it's about etiquette. You shouldn't misuse others bandwidth and resources this way. So, having some fun now with renaming a few pictures :)</p>
