<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://phandroid.com/2009/05/28/google-io-intro-video-wtf/">Google I/O Intro Video (WTF)</a></h3>
<p>Funny and interesting intro/demo of what's possible with HTML5. Also, great soundtrack.</p>
<h3><a href="http://tiltshiftmaker.com/">tiltshiftmaker.com - Transform your photos into tilt-shift style miniatures</a></h3>
<p>Discover the world in miniature. Awesome!</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/05/28/atp-photofinder-pro-loses-the-base-station-takes-us-to-geotaggi/">ATP PhotoFinder Pro: automagic geotagging of your digital images</a></h3>
<p>Just make sure your cam's clock is aligned with the GPS geotagger and go make your pics. Afterwards, put your memory card in it (no CF slot though...) and have it magically geotag them all with the right coordinates.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.nugigeruli.com/">Nugigeruli: great music</a></h3>
<p>Site by a friend/colleague of mine with the electronic music he makes in cooperation with a friend of his (also making use of real instruments). I really like what they're creating, and they don't mind sharing with the world. There should be quite some of their work online soon, so be sure to check it out.</p>
