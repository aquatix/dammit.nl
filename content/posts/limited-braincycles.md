Do you know that feeling that halfway through the day you start to be less 'fresh'?

This process means that during the day, your focus gradually decreases. This makes morning the best time to do work that needs inspiration, imagination and creativity. Meetings then are generally better done in the afternoon.

I call it having a finite amount of braincycles, but really it's 'just' biology. Research showed that [your brain gets smaller throughout the day](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2015/06/08/brain-bigger-in-the-morning/) and it gets polluted by waste materials and toxins that [get cleared away when you rest and sleep](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-sleep-clears-brain).
