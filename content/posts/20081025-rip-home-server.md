<p>I just bought a nice new, quiet Zalman 15mm thin cooling for her, cleaned her from dust, even cleaned the partitions of her hdd before powering down, but suddenly <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=310">luna, my trusty home server/media box</a> doesn't want to boot anymore. Worse, she doesn't even <acronym title="POwer-up Self Test">POST</acronym> anymore. No VGA signal, no beep, no lights on a keyboard, just putting electricity on her guts, but staying dead otherwise.</p>

<p>It's a sad day.</p>

<p>Actually, it already happened yesterday, but I couldn't seem to revive her today either. Her hdd is in a usb enclosure now, subversion repositories moved and project files backupped (thankfully).</p>

<p>In more happy news, the <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=754">SqueezeBox I wanted</a> and ordered this week arrived yesterday and I've been playing a bit with it today. It's neat, it's awesome, it Just Works&trade; and is just plain fun to toy around with. Can't wait to hook it up to our hifi :)</p>
