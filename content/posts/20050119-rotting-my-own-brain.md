<p>I think I'm procrastinating too much [sic]. Being lazy is good [as most programmers know], but I've got no real challenges at the moment, or don't have time for them because of the finals and projects I have to do. I can think of some nice entertaining challenges [like learning <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> and maybe even <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and creating some <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">nice tools</a> in it], but I have to restrain myself to finish my finals and those projects first.</p>
<p>Being bored makes me very creative, so I've come up with some neat new plans, which I'm going to write down fast so I can do them *later*. Sigh...</p>

<p>I could as well jot them down here:</p>
<ul>
<li>make info blurps like the <a href="/ns/">NS storingen</a> and the <a href="/traffic/">dutch traffic jam</a> pages modular so you can include them all on one page if you like [at least it will be better maintainable and expandable]. I want them all on my start page :)</li>
<li>create a similar module for showing number of unread e-mails in your boxes [simple as hell, as I don't want to have it show more details about the e-mails online]</li>
<li>create a database driven <a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">Gaim</a> log archive: upload a tarball/zip file to the server, which parses your logs and dumps it in a simple SQL database for easy online lookups. Would be nice to have, as I'm using that <acronym title="Instant Messaging">IM</acronym> on at least three different workstations, at various places</li>
<li>create a <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">bloglines.com</a> clone, but only for the feed reader part. That'd be a nice project to do in <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>, regarding <a href="http://diveintomark.org/projects/feed_parser/">Marks Universal Feed Parser</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'll just bookmark this blurp and implement all this when I'm done polluting my brain with those finals, finishing those projects and moving to our neat little apartment. Note that I need to create some subdomains with apache's virtual server too. Future fun :)</p>
