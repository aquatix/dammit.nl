<p>I forgot to mention I installed the nice graphical environment <a href="http://www.x.org">x.org</a> on my desktop, as it enables me to <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/gallery/v/screenies/linux/20050725_xorg_xfwm4_composite_03.png.html">have neat [mac OS-X-like] shadows and transparency</a>. Too bad I had to use an old version of my window manager [old beta of xfwm4], because I couldn't get my recompiled xfwm4 to show those nice effects through composite. Ah well :)</p>
