<p>OK, just heard I have the Databases course in my pocket too. Finally a cool grade [a 7 out of 10, while speeding through the answers like noone else in the room that day]. Only about three [maths] courses to go, to finish my Bachelor Project Paper, and I can look forward to rounding up my Master [as I've been doing some Master courses already].</p>

<p>Finally!</p>
