<p>I've been playing with <a href="/">site aquariusoft.org site</a> the last few days, and you may have noticed quite a few changes coming and going. Currently I'm quite pleased with how things are looking [having a more experienced graphical designer taking a look at it and swallowing his critics helped too]. It also shows how you can play with Cascading Style Sheets with [almost] the same HTML. Compare for example <a href="/">the aquariusoft.org site</a> with the [Dutch] <a href="http://www.mapleleaves.nl/">Mapleleaves</a> site. Maybe I should take a second look at that one too ;)</p>

<p>Hm, what am I doing here at this time? It's getting a tad chill...</p>
