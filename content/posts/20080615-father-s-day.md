<p>Some people find it a stupid concept [a bit like how I find Valentine's day overrated - why only be sweet to your lover then?], but I think it's a good day to show your dad you appreciate his existence and actions :) Maybe I'm just blessed with my old man, but I think showing that you really am thankful for his unselfish help fixing random things by giving him some decent audio equipment isn't that much to ask. [Don't worry, those ear buds weren't *that* expensive ;)]</p>
