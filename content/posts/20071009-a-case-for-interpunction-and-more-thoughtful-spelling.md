<blockquote><p>A panda walks into a caf&eacute;. He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a gun and proceeds to fire it at the other patrons.</p>

<p>"Why?" asks the confused, surviving waiter amidst the carnage, as the panda makes towards the exit. The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm a panda," he says at the door. "Look it up."</p>

<p>The waiter turns to the relevant entry in the manual and, sure enough, finds an explanation. "Panda. Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves."</p></blockquote>
