<p>As some may have noticed, <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/">the aquariusoft.org</a> site has been overhauled in the last weeks. It's now based on the <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/html/qik/">Qik site framework</a> I wrote from scratch. Today, I released a first snapshot to the public. There's a small HOWTO included, but <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/html/qik/">the project page</a> itself already contains a more up-to-date one. Enjoy!</p>
