<p>Today the new pharmacy of my girlfriend opens. It's all a bit thight on schedule, as they didn't have enough time to test handing out orders with their computer system and the robot enough, and not all of their orders where in on time. So, let's hope everything smoothes out this week [hopefully today already], and they can start enjoying their nifty new working environment. Too bad every computer runs Windows [even the various machines controlling the storage robot - which in itself is quite a cool piece of technique, if not a tad huge], but at least they'll run OpenOffice.org and Firefox and Thunderbird where needed [most will act as terminal for the pharmaceutical system].</p>

<p>Ah, the first 800 people will get a little present btw :)</p>
