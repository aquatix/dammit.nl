<p>Well look at me. Now I'm completely happy being online with a laptop without any wires or other plug-in thingees [like a wifi card]. It's running from it's battery and using one of the [heavily secured] wifi spots at the <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/">VU</a> with it's build-in wifi mini-pc-card-thingee. Too bad I have to use a proprietary client [<a href="http://www.mtghouse.com/">Aegis</a>], but at least I've a license for it :)</p>
<p>Parallel Programming exam went quite OK; it wasn't the disaster I thought it was going to be, so I guess that's a pro. I'll see.</p>
