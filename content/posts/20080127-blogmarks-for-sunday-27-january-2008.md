<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/gmail-feature-suggestion/">What Gmail feature do you want the most?</a></h3>
<p>Hm, what's up with people basing their business on a webmail service like gmail? Is it the safeness of having it in the Cloud? [backups etc.] I can imagine the filters, labels etc of gmail are handy, but if I'm running a business, I'd rather have a decent imaps server myself...</p>

<h3><a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/23/1942241">Saving in OOXML Format Now Probably A Bad Idea</a></h3>
<blockquote><p><a href="//slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/15/2248243&amp;tid=109">Much drama is unfolding</a> prior to the OOXML Ballot Resolution Meeting in Geneva, currently schedule for the end of February. After that there's a subsequent 30 day period while countries can still change their vote. As a result, Bob Sutor is recommending that saving your documents in OOXML format right now is <a href="http://www.sutor.com/newsite/blog-open/?p=2031">probably about the riskiest thing you can do</a>, if you are concerned with long term interoperability. At this point nobody has the vaguest idea what OOXML will look like in February, or even whether it will be in any sort of stable condition by the end of March.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/01/23/microsoft-koan">On IE8's yet another rendering mode</a></h3>
<p>Links to two articles that are a must read. The first is from the microsoft IE8 team about their latest Quirkmode, with comments that should come as a cold shower to the authors of that engine. The second is about microsoft going to miss the boat if they keep breaking the web. Good stuff</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/waf/">W.A.F.</a></h3>
<p>But she's a girl on <acronym title="wife acceptance factor">W.A.F.</acronym> [an issue lots of men run into]:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>wife acceptance factor</em> n. In an object, especially an electronic device, that normally appeals only to men, the qualities or features added to or modified in the object to make it acceptable to women.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>W.A.F. (or the mis-perception of it) is probably responsible for all those gadget manufacturers who think that if they make their gadget pink (or cover it with diamant&eacute;), 90% of the female population will be falling over themselves to buy it. They are wrong. Instead, I suspect that the majority of W.A.F. related conflicts arise because women who are not interested in hi-fi don't want their husbands spending half of their income on ruinously expensive stuff (and what the stuff is hardly matters in that context), or their living room to be filled with large lumps of metal and cables.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/05/22/deserted-japanese-is.html">Deserted Japanese island photo gallery</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Off the westernmost coast of Japan, is an island called "Gunkanjima" that is hardly known even to the Japanese. Long ago, the island was nothing more than a small reef. Then in 1810, the chance discovery of coal drastically changed the fate of this reef. As reclamation began, people came to live here, and through coal mining the reef started to expand continuously. Before long, the reef had grown into an artificial island of one kilometer (three quarters of a mile) in perimeter, with a population of 5300. Eventually, the mines faced an end, and in 1974 the world's once most densely populated island become totally deserted. The island, after all its inhabitants departed leaving behind their belongings, became an empty shell of a city where all its people disappeared overnight, as if by some mysterious act of God.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/22/1358237"> Corporate Email Etiquette - Dead or Alive?</a></h3>
<p>So many people ruining the flow of an email conversation/thread by replying wrongly or breaking the threading [microsoft-made email software tends to do the latter]. Is it so much work to remove old cruft from the email, and *not* to top-post? When you reply to various pieces of the email, you're not likely to forget something also. And remove all those `from: ', `to: ' etc things from the email body... And, while I'm at it: I'm not interested in a broadcasted email discussion [e.g., a To: <all-addresses-you-could-find> mail] about some trivial subject, on which everyone replying does so with the Reply-All button.</p>

<blockquote><p>In a two-part column in Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, Robert Silverberg tells the incredible story of the Cleve Cartmill affair: in 1944, John W Campbell published a story by the writer Cleve Cartmill that laid out an eerily accurate depiction of how the atom bomb would work, prompting a panicked -- and sometimes comical -- intelligence investigation into a putative conspiracy of science fiction writers:-</p></blockquote>
