<p>While trying to find an old link I put in my <a href="blogmarks.php">blogmarks</a> repository, I found out to my astonishment I didn't even have navigation for that section. So when I had some time today [exam was over quite fast - haven't decided if that's a Good Thing(tm)] I fixed that issue right away. While being on it, I fixed the permalink thingees of each blogmark too, so you can now link to one directly [dunno if that's handy, but at least you can :)]. Furthermore I now let the Old rants link at the end of the home page link to the second page of rant entries. No need to load the current ones again :) [They are not _that_ interesting anyway].</p>
