<p>Yeah I know it's already Sunday the 4th. So what?</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.metronieuws.nl">the dead tree newspaper I read regularly</a> [Dutch site], there was a quote from a lawyer, stating "If integrating means you do blindly what Bush says, lets pray to Allah, Buddha and Jesus we won't integrate" [original Dutch version: "Als integreren betekent dat je blind achter Bush aanloopt, laten we dan Allah, Boeddha en Jezus bidden dat we niet integreren" - Advocaat Prem Radhakishun in Intermediair, 1 april]. How true. Also, some high cop person says "With less cops we can do more". I wonder who's the "we". [Dutch: "Met minder agenten kunnen wij meer doen" - Korpschef Anja Grootonk van Noord-Holland-Noord in de Volkskrant, 1 april]</p>

<p>On a whole different note, <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/how_to/the_nonexpert_breastfeeding_la_carte.php">The Non-Expert: Breastfeeding &#192; La Carte</a> is an article about wether breastfeeding is suitable in a certain restaurant.
