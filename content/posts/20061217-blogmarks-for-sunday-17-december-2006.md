<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/15/sonic_art_weapon_rav.html">Sonic art weapon: Ravezooka</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>"The Ravezooka is a musical weapon that shoots powerful "hardcore" sounds based on your target's distance from the instrument. Squeezing the trigger handle initiates sound and a beam of light. As the user moves the Ravezooka around, the frequency range being played changes based on the distance of the person or object in front of the instrument. The closer the target, the lower the frequency range."</p></blockquote>

In the closed box there is either one million dollars or there is nothing. You are to choose between taking both boxes or taking the closed box only. But there's a catch.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.sincerechoice.org/">Sincere Choice</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Today's software market does not provide a <i>level
playing field</i> upon which all software producers can
compete fairly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vendors use deliberately incompatible
intercommunication and file formats to lock out their
competition.</li>

<li>The customer is often locked into a particular
product due to the need to interoperate with other
customers who have selected that product.</li>

<li>Legislation tends to favor proprietary software over
Open Source, since Open Source has only recently attained
a significant role in business.</li>
</ul>

<p>We seek to provide a fair market in which Proprietary
and Open Source software can compete solely on their
merits.</p></blockquote>
