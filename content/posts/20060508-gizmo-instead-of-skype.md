<p>After reinstalling my laptop from scratch with a Debian netinstall cd [<a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=386">the old harddrive died on me :(</a>], I installed the <a href="http://www.gizmoproject.com/">Gizmo <acronym title="Voice Over IP">VOIP</acronym> client</a>. I think it's better than <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a>; it uses the ALSA sound system, native GTK2 [so it actually looks good], and is based on the open standard SIP. Too bad it's not Open Source. However, <a href="http://www.gnomemeeting.org/">the Ekiga VOIP client</a> [formerly known as Gnome Meeting] is. And that one even supports webcams :)</p>

<p>The only thing Skype does better is group chats. Still, I'm not going to install that client again; they seem to be working on ALSA support, but it hasn't shown up after 9 months, and it's just too proprietary for me to trust it'll work out OK. So, anybody has a Gizmo account or SIP address he/she wants to share with me? :)</p>

<p>BTW, just like Skype, Gizmo has a client for the Mac and Windows too. A Windows port of Ekiga is also in the making, so there's no good reason not to try something other than Skype :)</p>
