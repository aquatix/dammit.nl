<p>Well, not quite magically as I updated our router to the latest snapshot of DD-WRT, but apparently a lot has been fixed since version 24 SP1. If you have issues with your router running DD-WRT, try the latest snapshot too. <a href="http://dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=39529">More info in this forum thread</a>.</p>
