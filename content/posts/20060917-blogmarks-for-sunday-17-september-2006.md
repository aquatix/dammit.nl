<h3><a href="http://www.nu.nl/news/825734/50/%27Ambtenaren_saboteren_ICT_voor_miljoenen_euro%27s%27.html">[Dutch] 'Ambtenaren saboteren ICT voor miljoenen euro's'</a></h3>
<p>Hm, civil servants sabotaging ICT projects because they don't want something to change or have other plans on their agenda. What's it with clerks and work anyway? :)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail207.html">Interview with Joel Spolsky from Joel on Software</a></h3>

<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/09/13/princeton_researcher.html">Princeton researchers show how to steal an election with Diebold machines</a></h3>
<p>Only costs you about a minute. So far for those *really secure!!!* voting machines. Also, a voting-machine-virus isn't sci-fi, as the Diebold machines all run windows, and are -- if I remember correctly -- networked...</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/09/how-design-works">How design works</a></h3>
<p>It really all boils down to [black? :)] magic and some trust from the client to the developer</p>
<h3><a href="http://community.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/09/05/1547205">CodeYard is a playground for students of open source</a></h3>
<p>Ah, so there *are* Dutch school projects encouraging students to participate in <acronym title="Open Source Software">OSS</acronym> and its projects</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/09/12/douglas_adamss_1990_.html">Douglas Adams's 1990 BBC doc on hypertext, with Tom Baker</a></h3>
<blockquote><p class="quote">Douglas Adams hosts his 1990 BBC documentary on hypertext, Hyperland, in which he talks about early hypertext efforts at the Media Lab, the state of the Xanadu project, the history of Vannevar bush, etc. It's quite funny, and almost entirely disconnected from the hypertext that actually took hold in the world: the Web.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/09/11/us_journalist_charge.html">US Journalist charged with videotaping "critical national security structure"</a></h3>
<blockquote><p class="quote">On August 22, for LinkTV and Democracy Now! we videotaped the thousands of Katrina evacuees still held behind a barbed wire in a trailer park encampment a hundred miles from New Orleans. It's been a year since the hurricane and 73,000 POW's (Prisoners of W) are still in this aluminum ghetto in the middle of nowhere.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/09/11/lawbot_open_expert_s.html">Lawbot: open expert system for legal "advice"</a></h3>
<p>Interesting way of automating legal "advice" by using a decision-tree and providing a means to plug holes in the law</p>

<p>And you already thought the patent system was fucked up? ;)</p>
