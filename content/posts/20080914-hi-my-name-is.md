<p>When I saw <a href="http://buranen.info/?p=283">burner's post of device names</a>, I thought I'd make it a meme :) Or at least, add my own list:</p>

<ul>
<li>river - workstation</li>
<li>galadriel - laptop</li>
<li>aquatix - nokia n810 internet tablet</li>
<li>comm - cellphone</li>
<li>luna - home server</li>
<li>higgs - colocated server</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the devices/machines I currently use daily. I have a Sony Cli&eacute; palm that's also called aquatix, and my previous workstation (no longer existing) was called serenity. Yeah, both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_(Firefly_vessel)">Serenity</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Tam#River_Tam">River (Tam)</a> are names from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)">Firefly</a> :)</p>
