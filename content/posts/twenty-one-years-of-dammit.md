This is going to be brief, because it has been a long week and this has been a tiring day with some unplanned setbacks which in the end thankfully were undone, throwing away the work done with it. But hey, we're still here!

What also is still here is my lovely garden. I love that I have this little corner of the internet, all of my own, to tell the void about discoveries and neat things, to rant on about things that do not go according to plan or that are just really itchy.

With twenty-one (21!) years in its book ([yes really]({filename}../posts/20031221-my-very-own-rantbox.md)), you could say that dammIT really has matured. You could say a lot of things, and I will say more in the days to come as I have a few drafts sitting around for too long, but for now I'm just quietly enjoying the peace of mind that - unless I majorly screw up for some reason - this little wordbox will be right here, with no attempt to enshittify itself or rot in other ways.

Enjoy your day too, dear reader, and please drop by next time if you like.
