<p>I actually did something today besides crawling too many news sites and web logs: I helped someone with Computer Networks assignment [again], and set up a <a href="/forum/">forum</a>. Yeah people, that's right: <a href="/">aquariusoft.org</a> has a forum! Now you can dump you annoyances about <a href="/forum/viewforum.php?id=4">aquamorph</a>, <a href="/forum/viewforum.php?id=3">GNU/Linux</a> and <a href="/forum/viewforum.php?id=2">windows</a> in one tidy place. Of course there are several other forums as well, so be sure to check it out and be sure to say something positive too ;)</p>
