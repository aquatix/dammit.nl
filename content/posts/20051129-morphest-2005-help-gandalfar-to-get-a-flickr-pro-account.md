<p>As both he and I ran out of our monthly rate, he's persuiting a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> Pro account so he can upload as much as he want. It's a really nice geeky and thoroughly tought out tool, so it would be a nice gift for him. So if you like Gandalfar [and who doesn't? ;)], get him an account in exchange for a customized livecd!</p>
