<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004508.html">I'm in your forum... posting in a grammatically accurate manner</a></h3>
<p>Cats rule ;)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.pidgin.im/~seanegan/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi/momentum">Sean Egan about some design decisions of the pidgin interface</a></h3>
<p>Complete with a minor history of the gaim/pidgin GUI</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.physorg.com/news98367923.html">Cluster spacecraft makes a shocking discovery</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>On 24 January 2001, the four Cluster spacecraft were flying at an approximate altitude of 105 000 kilometres, in tetrahedron formation. Each spacecraft was separated from the others by a distance of about 600 kilometres. With such a distance between them, as they approached the bow shock, scientists expected that every spacecraft would record a similar signature of the passage through this region. Instead, the readings they got were highly contradictory. They showed large fluctuations in the magnetic and electric field surrounding each spacecraft. They also revealed marked variations in the number of solar wind protons that were reflected by the shock and streaming back to Sun.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Golgafrinchans">Golgafrinchans</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Ancient people described in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. The original Golgafrinchans decided to rid themselves of all of their "below average" population by blasting them off into space. This had the unfortunate side effect that all of the sanitary workers were removed, and the Golgafrinchans were killed off by germs. All of the hairdressers, insurance agents, and managers that were launched into space actually did survive and ended up on earth as our ancestors.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2007/microsoft-linux-patent-violations/">Why Microsoft Won't ID Patent Violations...</a></h3>
<p>Because either they will be too trivial to defend properly, or they could be worked around. Microsoft would loose their leverage and be high and dry without any way to scare companies and people away from OSS</p>
<h3><a href="http://todotxt.com/">Todo.txt - Task tracking for command line lovers</a></h3>
<p>Even has a plugin so you can read and write your todo.txt by using Jabber. Neat :)</p>

<p>Also check the self-contained <a href="http://www.henspace.co.uk/ikog/">iKog</a>, about which <a href="http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/04/23/1954251">Linux.com has a nice little howto</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/next-generation-high-performance-processor-unveiled-13080.html">Next-generation, high-performance processor unveiled | Science Blog</a></h3>
<p>Interesting material, as those are ground-up designed to do a lot at the same time, instead of just hooking up more single cores to each other.</p>

<blockquote><p>Each TRIPS chip contains two processing cores, each of which can issue 16 operations per cycle with up to 1,024 instructions in flight simultaneously. Current high-performance processors are typically designed to sustain a maximum execution rate of four operations per cycle.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/index.htm">Microsoft claims software like Linux violates its patents</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft takes on the free world. Microsoft claims that free software like Linux, which runs a big chunk of corporate America, violates 235 of its patents. It wants royalties from distributors and users. Users like you, maybe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sooo, any windows fanboys out there wanting to finance this corporate terrorism?</p>
