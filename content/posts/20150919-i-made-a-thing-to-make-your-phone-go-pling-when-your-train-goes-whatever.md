I made a thing: [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nsapi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nsapi).

You can use it with my other thing at [https://github.com/aquatix/ns-notifications](https://github.com/aquatix/ns-notifications) to get notified when your train is late, or to know when you can do a sprint upstairs on the next station because your otherwise impossible transfer is delayed a bit and you can catch it now.

See the [settings_example.py](https://github.com/aquatix/ns-notifications/blob/master/settings_example.py) and the [ns-notifications README](https://github.com/aquatix/ns-notifications/blob/master/README.md) to configure.

Enjoy!

PS: yeah, it makes use of the official Nationale Spoorwegen (NS/Dutch Railways) API, and you need to request a key with them to use it. That's easy though and worth it if you like timely notifications.
