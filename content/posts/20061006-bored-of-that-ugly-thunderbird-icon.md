<p>OK, after finding me <a href="http://moztraybiff.mozdev.org/">a tray icon plugin for the Linux version of Thunderbird</a>, I came to the conclusion that the default icon Debian is shipping with it [the non-branded Mozilla icon], is just ugly. It's a aliased icon [read: jagged edges etc], brown, and doesn't play nice with my <a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/">Tango icon theme</a>. So I looked where the default icons are stored and simply replaced them by stock Tango icons :)</p>

<p>How? Go to /usr/lib/thunderbird/chrome/icons/default, select some [Tango] icons you want to use as replacement, save them as .xpm files and overwrite the ones in that directory. You can <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/files/linux/thunderbird_tango_icons.tar.bz2">download my Thunderbird Tango icons here</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, a complete <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/29228376/">Tango icon theme for Firefox can be downloaded here</a>, and <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/29248425/">one for Thunderbird can be found there too</a>.</p>

<p>A screenshot says a lot too:</p>

<br style="clear: both;" />

<p>I also put a <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/files/linux/gaim_2.0_tango.tar.bz2">Tango theme for Gaim 2.0</a> online. Enjoy :)</p>

<p>Clarified some text and fixed the uri pointing to the Thunderbird tray icon. Sorry :)</p>
