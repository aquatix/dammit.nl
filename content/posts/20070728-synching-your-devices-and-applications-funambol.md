<p>I got <a href="http://www.funambol.com/">the Funambol SyncML server</a> working with my SonyEricsson M600i smartphone this evening. This software [formerly known as sync4j] enables you to synchronise all kinds of [mobile] devices and <acronym title="Personal Information Manager">PIM</acronym> software with SyncML. Like my M600i and Evolution [however, I didn't get the <a href="http://www.estamos.de/projects/SyncML/">SyncEvolution</a> synchroniser working with Evolution 2.10.3 yet], and in the future maybe a Nokia N800, for example :) Or I could get my trusty old Sony Clie palm in the PIM race again ;)</p>
