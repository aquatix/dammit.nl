<p><a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/98515/">IBM files counterclaim against SCO</a>, saying SCO "literally copied more than 783,000 lines of code from these sixteen packages of IBM's copyrighted material". Now, that code is licensed under the <acronym title="GNU General Public License">GPL</acronym> and/or <acronym title="GNU Lesser General Public License">LGPL</acronym>, but SCO has renounced, disclaimed, and breached the GPL and therefore the GPL does not give SCO permission or a license to copy and distribute IBM's copyrighted works. Nice move!</p>
<p>Another reexamination is pending and hovering above me like some dangerous axe or Sword of Damocles. It's some algebra and discrete mathematics thing, which I can't quite make myself enthousiastic for, but is quite important nonetheless. Hope I make myself exercise enough for the thing, otherwise I've to take the classes again [makes my understanding a lot better I guess, but whatever].</p>
<p>On the upside, I'm running the first GNU/Linux kernel with 3 dots in it's version [kernel 2.6.8.1], with ACPI support for my laptop, so I can see the battery status and other neat things, thanks to Kano from <a href="http://kanotix.mipooh.net/viewtopic.php?t=2401">Kanotix</a>. Good to be lurking on IRC [join #morphix at irc.freenode.org :) ]</p>
