<p>I baked some testing versions today, spawning <a href="/images/screenies/aquamorph/20040726_aquamorph_screenshot_02.png">this result</a>. Not that it's earth shattering or an even remotely interesting screenie, but it's the new aquamorph coming to fruition.</p>
<p>I just finished a little help document and an update of the installed packages [ooh, some last-minute update of <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">xfce4</a>!], and am now making a new main module. This feels good :)</p>
