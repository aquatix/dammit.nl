Today this little web corner has existed for sixteen years. Funny thing is that 'sixteen years' does not even sound that long anymore in my ears, while it is enough for a newborn to grow into a person nearing maturity. While I would not say this weblog is really mature (how could it be when I cherish the child in me?), its content has shifted from short blurps of thoughts and snippets of my life to more technically howto related articles the last few years.

I like writing those articles, but they take quite some time and effort. At the same time, I kind of stopped using Twitter and its microblogging ways. I tried Mastodon for a bit, but that endeavour petered out quite fast, for the same reason I stopped Twitter cold turkey. I used Twitter as a way of feeding me tech news for years, and I switched to exclusively using Inoreader with a selection of RSS feeds for that. I miss the interaction of people a bit, but it saves me even more time, which I rather spend on a good book, a tv series, some hobby programming, or hey, even some family interaction ðŸ˜„
