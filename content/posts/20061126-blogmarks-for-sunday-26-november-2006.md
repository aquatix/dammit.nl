<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/22/old_engravings_of_an.html">Boing Boing: Old engravings of animals are charmingly strange</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The absurd rendering of many of the animals comes about because the engravers/artists working on the project did not actually see the animals. They had to rely on descriptions and their imagination and, as was the fashion of the time, the animals were placed in contrived settings and often given human facial qualities, which only serves to heighten the sense of bizarre. And thankful we are too.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/21.html">Choices = Headaches</a></h3>

<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/08/lore_sjaberg_riffs_o.html">Boing Boing: Lore SjÃ¶berg riffs on Vista EULA</a></h3>
<p>Riff on the Windows Vista EULA:</p>
<blockquote><p>Windows DRM: You may not use this system to remove DRM protection from Microsoft-provided media. "Removing DRM" is defined as stripping out protection, reverse-engineering code, using third-party circumvention software, installing non-DRM versions of DRM media, refusing to purchase our media in the first place, or reading Boing Boing.</p>
<p>Future Licenses: By using Windows Vista, you agree to not only this license, but to any future revisions to this license. You also agree to any future licenses for other products from Microsoft, whether or not you actually purchase them, and to any revisions to those licenses, including terms that require you to agree to other licenses, and revisions to those licenses. You agree that if you attempt to not agree to these licenses, then you automatically agree to yet another license, and it's a lot harsher than this license, so just watch yourself.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs Is a Bozo: You don't have to agree to this. We just felt it needed to be said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let's just say Microsoft's EULA's are bad, mkay?</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/17/zune_ad_spoofs.html">Boing Boing: Zune ad spoofs</a></h3>
<p>Funny and nail-on-head about the featured DRM</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/17/uk_rfid_passports_cr.html">Boing Boing: UK RFID passports cracked</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>UK security experts have cracked the sooper sekure new UK biometric passports. It took 48 hours. With &pound;174 worth of sniffer hardware, attackers can read all the personal information off of any of the three million new UK passports in circulation -- and if combined with demonstrated hacks for reading RFIDs at a distance, this could happen from across the room, or even farther. You can then clone the RFID and stick it in another passport (surprise! your identity is now owned by a terrorist!).</p></blockquote>

<p>Our own Dutch biometric passport has been cracked for over a year already too. Gotta love the security our goverments ensure us!</p>
