<p>Feeling uninspired lately. Anyone knowing how to get into a nice buzz again? It would surely help to get things done again :)</p>

<p>(I generally get psyched when discovering/using some interesting new technique, and I have some ideas for using multiple in a new project. However, I'd like to finish several of my current projects first... Also, it's a motivational issue. How do I get motivated for an older project again? Any tips?)</p>
