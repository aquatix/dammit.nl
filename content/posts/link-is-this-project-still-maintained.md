If you - like me - regularly check out sourcecode (read: Git) repositories of projects that you stumble across or use in a hobby project/product or at work, you will now and then find one or more issues in their tracker with a title similar to the above, often with remarks by others chiming in, and sometimes even kind hearts offering to help out.

[Matt Palmer](https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/) recently wrote a piece on this exact subject that resonated with me. Not only did I see it happen numerous times in projects that I use personally or professionally, or thought about starting to use, but on the flip side, I'm a developer myself with clearly 'alive' projects, and repositories of code online that are collecting dustbunnies and interesting insects, including still-open Snyk and dependabot pull requests. Life just sometimes is that way, priorities and such.

Please read [Matt's post](https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/2024/05/14/is-this-project-still-maintained.html) for more background on the matter.

The original weblog looks like it is not going anywhere, but in case the post ever drops off the earth, I'd like to include the manifesto Matt Palmer came up with here verbatim:

> ## Is This Project Still Maintained?
>
> Yes. Maybe. Actually, perhaps no. Well, really, it depends on what you mean by “maintained”.
>
> I wrote the software in this repo for my own benefit – to solve the problems I had, when I had them. While I could have kept the software to myself, I instead released it publicly, under the terms of an open licence, with the hope that it might be useful to others, but with no guarantees of any kind. Thanks to the generosity of others, it costs me literally nothing for you to use, modify, and redistribute this project, so have at it!
>
> ## OK, Whatever. What About Maintenance?
>
> In one sense, this software is “maintained”, and always will be. I fix the bugs that annoy me, I upgrade dependencies when not doing so causes me problems, and I add features that I need. To the degree that any on-going development is happening, it’s because I want that development to happen.
>
> However, if “maintained” to you means responses to questions, bug fixes, upgrades, or new features, you may be somewhat disappointed. That’s not “maintenance”, that’s “support”, and if you expect support, you’ll probably want to have a “[support contract](https://tobermorytech.com)”, where we come to an agreement where you pay me money, and I help you with the things you need help with.
>
> ## That Doesn’t Sound Fair!
>
> If it makes you feel better, there are several things you _are_ entitled to:
>
> 1. The ability to use, study, modify, and redistribute the contents of this repository, under the terms stated in the applicable licence(s).
> 2. That any interactions you may have with myself, other contributors, and anyone else in this project’s spaces will be in line with the published Code of Conduct, and any transgressions of the Code of Conduct will be dealt with appropriately.
> 3. … actually, that’s it.
>
> Things that you are not entitled to include an answer to your question, a fix for your bug, an implementation of your feature request, or a merge (or even review) of your pull request. Sometimes I may respond, either immediately or at some time long afterwards. You may luck out, and I’ll think “hmm, yeah, that’s an interesting thing” and I’ll work on it, but if I do that in any particular instance, it does not create an entitlement that I will continue to do so, or that I will ever do so again in the future.
>
> ## But… I’ve Found a Huge and Terrible Bug!
>
> You have my full and complete sympathy. It’s reasonable to assume that I haven’t come across the same bug, or at least that it doesn’t bother me, otherwise I’d have fixed it for myself.
>
> Feel free to report it, if only to warn other people that there is a huge bug they might need to avoid (possibly by not using the software at all). Well-written bug reports are great contributions, and I appreciate the effort you’ve put in, but the work that you’ve done on your bug report still doesn’t create any entitlement on me to fix it.
>
> If you _really_ want that bug fixed, the source is available, and the licence gives you the right to modify it as you see fit. I encourage you to dig in and fix the bug. If you don’t have the necessary skills to do so yourself, you can get someone else to fix it – everyone has the same entitlements to use, study, modify, and redistribute as you do.
>
> You may also decide to pay me for a [support contract](https://tobermorytech.com), and get the bug fixed that way. That gets the bug fixed for everyone, and gives you the bonus warm fuzzies of contributing to the digital commons, which is always nice.
>
> ## But… My PR is a Gift!
>
> If you take the time and effort to make a PR, you’re doing good work and I commend you for it. However, that doesn’t mean I’ll necessarily merge it into this repository, or even work with you to get it into a state suitable for merging.
>
> A PR is what is often called a “gift of work”. I’ll have to make sure that, at the very least, it doesn’t make anything actively _worse_. That includes introducing bugs, or causing maintenance headaches in the future (which includes my getting irrationally angry at indenting, because I’m like that). Properly reviewing a PR takes me _at least_ as much time as it would take me to write it from scratch, in almost all cases.
>
> So, if your PR languishes, it might not be that it’s bad, or that the project is (dum dum dummmm!) “unmaintained”, but just that I don’t accept this particular gift of work at this particular time.
>
> Don’t forget that the terms of licence include permission to redistribute modified versions of the code I’ve released. If you think your PR is all that and a bag of potato chips, fork away! I won’t be offended if you decide to release a permanent fork of this software, as long as you comply with the terms of the licence(s) involved.
>
> (Note that I do _not_ undertake support contracts solely to review and merge PRs; that reeks a little too much of “pay to play” for my liking)
>
> ## Gee, You Sound Like an Asshole
>
> I prefer to think of myself as “forthright” and “plain-speaking”, but that brings to mind that third thing you’re entitled to: your opinion.
>
> I’ve written this out because I feel like clarifying the reality we’re living in, in the hope that it prevents misunderstandings. If what I’ve written makes you not want to use the software I’ve written, that’s fine – you’ve probably avoided future disappointment.
