<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/11/26/monday-inspiration-user-experience-of-the-future/">User Experience Of The Future</a></h3>
<p>Really neat stuff, like real and very large full-colour holograms [Cheoptics360], the reactable and other neat interfaces. The multitouch I already saw over a year ago, but it's still amazing</p>
