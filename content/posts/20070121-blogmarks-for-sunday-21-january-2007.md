<p>Interesting piece about microprocessors [for embedded systems]</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/">The Ã…ngstrÃ¶m Distribution | Embedded power</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Ã…ngstrÃ¶m was started by a small group of people who worked on the OpenEmbedded, OpenZaurus and OpenSimpad projects to unify their effort to make a stable and userfriendly distribution for embedded devices like handhelds,set top boxes and network-attached storage devices.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.tyrannozaurus.com/?q=node/188">RIP Zaurus :(</a></h3>
<p>Noooos! Another pda manufacturer quits... OK, their software solution wasn't all that special, but that's where those OpenZaurus and other projects kicked in. Besides, it would've been nice to have a decent wifi and bluetooth chip in those clamshell models. Oh well, let's hope Access' Linux Platform [with PalmOS compatibility layer!] will turn out awesome. They have to build some really decent PDA's and smartphones around it though. 2007 hopefully is going to be an interesting smartphone year...</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/13/vista_suicide_note_r.html">Vista "suicide note" researcher interview on Security Now</a></h3>
<p>Good stuff. Wondering why it's better to skip Windows Vista and look ahead to alternatives? Read this piece, and <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/vista_cost.txt">the original article</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Vista is a disaster. Microsoft is so desperate to get the entertainment industry locked into its platform that they'll destroy themselves to get there. This is an operating system that, when idle, will have to check itself every 30 microseconds to make sure nothing is still happening, and no hackers are attacking it. It acts like an unmedicated paranoid. If Vista catches on, hundreds of millions of computers will be burning heptillions of cycles and tons of coal just making sure that no one is putting a voltmeter on the traces on its motherboard.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, if you thinker with your hardware frequently [swapping out hard drives for larger ones, upgrading your videocard once in a while etc], Vista and Microsoft get paranoid on you [<a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/blogmarks.php?year=2007&amp;month=01#uri1233">like I blogmarked before</a>].</p>
