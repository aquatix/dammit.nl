<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://notalwaysright.com/one-annoyed-paranoid/1358">One Annoyed Paranoid</a></h3>
<p>Heh, you can be *too* paranoid ;)</p>
<h3><a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081118-hands-on-zenbes-social-collaborative-e-mail-works-well.html">Hands on: Zenbe's social, collaborative e-mail works well</a></h3>
<p>Interesting software; I've been thinking about integrating mail, calendaring, contacts, files, todo etc. for a long while, and finally some decent solutions are starting to pop up.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/20/mozilla_2007_financials/">Firefox millions - only 12 per cent Google free</a></h3>
<p>Hmmmm, that's not good I guess</p>
<h3><a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/11/18/2326220">Fewer Than 1% Arrested From TSA's </a></h3>
<p>So far for terrorising your own people for nothing. Kudos.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/11/20/caption-contest-cat-drives-roomba-is-not-so-impressed-actua/">Caption contest: cat driving Roomba -- is not so impressed, actually</a></h3>
<p>Awwww, cute!</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.freshdot.net/irssi-irssi-rss.shtml">irssi-rss, the rss feeder for irssi</a></h3>
<p>I already use the really usable <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> (which is nicer to read comics in anyway), but this irssi script looks quite usable!</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/kidding.shtml">Comparing a $40000 39MP Hasselblad with a $500 Canon G10</a></h3>
<p>With surprising results</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/11/19/lego-safe-is-made-from-robot-parts-will-guard-your-mint-condish/">Lego safe is made from robot parts, will guard your mint condish Robocop figurines just nicely</a></h3>
<p>Whoa; I guess that's not demolition-proof though ;)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.nrcnext.nl/opinie/article2062989.ece/Alleen_de_naam_is_fout_van_Hyves-_vrienden">[Dutch] Alleen de naam is fout van Hyves</a></h3>
<p>I don't get the `friend'-inflation people practice on such sites, but it's of course an interesting phenomenon expanding your network of acquaintances that way. The whole Hyves site is awefully engineered though :)</p>
