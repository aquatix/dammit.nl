<p>It seems the NoScript author <a href="http://adblockplus.org/blog/attention-noscript-users">sneakily added some whitelist rules to people's Adblock Plus list so ads on his website are not blocked</a>. This might even have been OK by most people if only he had been frank and up-front about it. But he went further: he also *patched the AdBlockPlus code* to enable supporting ads on the NoScript site (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/reviews/display/722">see all the angry comments on the extension's page</a>). This suddenly makes it malware, as modifying code you are not supposed to touch is really Not Done.</p>

<p>The public outcry now seems to have resulted in an update which removed the offending code, but this surely has resulted in a distrust of the particular extension which people used to love.</p>
