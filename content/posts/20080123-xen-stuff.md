<p>I'm setting up a new server [called higgs, from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson">Higgs boson</a>], which is a Xen instance on soleus.nu. I tried to do some iptables stuff today, and ran into trouble with it not wanting to insmod the kernel modules. Turned out I had the [old] modutils installed on my Debian, and just needed to apt-get install module-init-tools. That one removed modutils too; iptables now works :)</p>

<p>For the curious: higgs will become my main web/mail/shell server, which will result in a lot faster service, as it's colocated at <a href="http://www.coloclue.net/">coloclue</a>. Technical specs are: single cpu, 512MB ram, 25GB hdd space [I can get more if I beg :)] as Xen instance on a dual Xeon 2.4GHz system.</p>
