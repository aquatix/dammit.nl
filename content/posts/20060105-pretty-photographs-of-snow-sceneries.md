<p>While celebrating christmas time in the high north of our small country, I took a hundred-ish pictures. Not only from us sitting around, but also from the scenery, from which I've put online some nice ones at <a href="http://luna.aquariusoft.org/albums/christmas2005/">this small album</a>. If you like one, you can always ask me to mail you the original/create a wallpaper for you ;)</p>
