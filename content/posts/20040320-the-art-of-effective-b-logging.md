<p><a href="http://www.gnomebangalore.org/?q=node/view/191">The Art of "Effective" B---------logging</a> is a fictional conversation between the protagonist and a skeptic, attempting to explain what a blog is, and why it's useful. Various points are made, but the skeptic doesn't seem to understand until the protagonist enthuses, "It is like meditation that comes thru karma."</p>
<p>"Ah, I understand that now."</p>
