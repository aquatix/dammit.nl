<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0K_LZDXp0I">Duck and Cover</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_and_cover">movie that was used to teach generations of United States school children from the late 1940s into the 1980s</a> about how to "protect" themselves against the explosion of an atomic bomb. Really unnerving</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14399933/from/RS.5/">The $170 million FBI computer upgrade that wasn't</a></h3>
<p>A painful story of how things can go awry. It's unsettling btw, how the FBI has been using paper files instead of a nice central computer system for so many years :/</p>
<h3><a href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Projects/Firefox/Firefox_Circle">Firefox crop circle</a></h3>
<p>Sweet! :)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS8030785497.html">Trolltech woos developers with "open" Linux phone</a></h3>
<p>Looks like a decent device! Maybe there'll be a community around it like with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_770">Nokia 770 tablet</a></p>
<h3><a href="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS7533886035.html">Access Linux Platform with Palm emulator approved</a></h3>
<p>That means that I can get a [smart]phone running Linux and run my current Palm programs on them too. Now I hope they will churn out some really decent smartphone with nice keyboard and battery life. Ah, and wifi dammit!</p>
<h3><a href="http://costofwar.com/">The Cost of the Iraq War</a></h3>
<p>It's an astonishing number...</p>
