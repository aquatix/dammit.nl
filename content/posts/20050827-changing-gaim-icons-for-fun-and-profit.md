<p>Today I found <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=22348">an alternative iconset</a> for the <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">Gaim instant messenger</a> application I use. I quite liked the overall look of the icons, so I copied it over the original ones [after having made a backup of the directory of course]. In <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> this is the /usr/share/pixmaps/gaim directory. However, I noticed that the 'Busy' icon was a pack of cigarettes [I hate smoking], and the 'has you not' icon was a hand. Both I didn't like in this config, so I copied the hand over the 'Busy' icon and replaced the hand itself with the little cross of 'do not disturb'. Now I got a quite decent arrangement.</p>

<p>After using it for an hour, the MSN butterfly started annoying me, so I copied the MSN dude back. The result is the following:</p>

<p>Of course you <a href="/files/gaim_iconset_modified.tar.bz2">can download the modified icon theme too</a>. The original icons are still included with the postfix _orig . These you can delete of course. Enjoy :)</p>
