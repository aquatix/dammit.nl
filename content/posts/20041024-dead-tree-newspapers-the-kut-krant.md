<p><a href="http://alextreme.org/">Alex</a> has made a good point in his <a href="http://www.alextreme.org/drupal/?q=node/view/271">Silly dead-tree media corp</a> posting; lots of dead trees are spent at that incredibly low-level newspaper, the <a href="http://www.telegraaf.nl/">Kut Krant</a>. I dunno, but I always have reservations against people reading that paper seriously, it's just so full of crap [exaggerating almost everything and talking about everything I couldn't care less about, like those silly tv programs and football]. And if they are going to sue websites [or whoever] over such silly keywords, they even sink lower in my rating.</p>
<p>But yeah, that's just the two of us. If you share my [and <a href="http://alextreme.org/">Alex</a>'] opinion, please link to this <a href="http://www.telegraaf.nl/">Kut Krant</a> in this kindly way ;)</p>
