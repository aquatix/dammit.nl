<p>I've been thinkering with the new design of my <a href="/">aquariusoft.org</a> website today, and I just fired up my laptop, booted it to win2k, started Firefox, browsed to the new version; everything fine. Opera 7; not everything fine, but fixed quite fast. IE 6; everything borked... I so hate it when browsers just don't get <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>!</p>
<p>Just compare <a href="/images/screenies/various/20040401_aqsoft_firefox.png">the Firefox one</a> with <a href="/images/screenies/various/20040401_aqsoft_opera.png">the Opera 7 one</a> and then weep at <a href="/images/screenies/various/20040401_aqsoft_ie6.png">the IE 6 one</a></p>
