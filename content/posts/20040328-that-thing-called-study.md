<p>I was reading some blogs at <a href="http://live.linuxchix.org/">Linuxchix</a> [yeah, I think geeky girls are interesting ;)], and I came along <a href="http://www.decafmocha.com/archives/2004_03.htm#001240">this posting from one Shari</a> about somehow not getting to get some studying done while you need it the most. She describes exact the same feeling I had last week. Even when I did studied hard, it didn't feel like the result was something constructive. Maybe I just suck.</p>
