<p>A thing that has amused me since last week is <a href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/bunny.php">this great animation and song</a> [Flash alert, but worth the loading]. There's also <a href="http://www.trunkmonkey.com/content/view/57/59/">a page with the Flash version and the songtext</a> and <a href="http://www.madman.com.au/tism/bunny/">one with two versions [original and radio edit] as Quicktime .mov</a>. The radio edit is worth watching too.</p>

<p>Another great animation with neat soundtrack is <a href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/drum.php">Drum Machine</a>.</p>

<p>I recently found the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/">Rotten.com library</a>. I always thought Rotten only hosted digusting pictures, but apparently they host quite a slew of amusing [yeah, really nice] stories too, from <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/">biographies</a> through <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/hoaxes/">hoaxes</a> and <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/conspiracy/">conspiracies</a> to <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/cryptozoology/">cryptozoology</a>. Interesting.</p>
