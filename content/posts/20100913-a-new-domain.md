<p>You might have noticed that this weblog has moved. It's still exactly the same rantbox as it has always been - hopefully with more regular updates than it has seen for quite a while - but now you can find it on its own domain: <a href="http://dammit.nl/">dammit.nl</a>. Links to the old aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt should be redirected here, but things might still break (old relative links to content on aquariusoft.org for example). Please, if you see anything broken, don't hesitate to notify me; both in a comment, an email me at michiel at dammit nl (or another email address you already know of me), or ping me on <a href="http://twitter.com/michielscholten">twitter</a> or something.</p>

<p>My weblog is not the only thing getting a new address; it looks like our new home is well underway to be ready for our eager souls to occupy. You might find some more information (likely of the photo kind) here soon.</p>
