<p>Apparently it started out as <a href="http://www.jurecuhalev.com/blog/2008/10/29/london-meme/">a London Meme</a>, but as it got passed on by <a href="http://www.barwap.com/blog/2008/oct/29/contagious-meme/">bmsleight to me</a>, and it's fun anyway, I'll post my answer here.</p>

<li>Top three non-work websites:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> (rss/atom feed reader, contains most of my news and recreational sources)</li>
<li><a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></li>
<li><a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three favourite cocktails:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojito">Mojito</a></li>
<li>A nice single-malt whisky without rocks or anything (no, not a cocktail, I'm more of a simple drink fan)</li>
<li>A nice cognac</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Top three karaoke songs:
<ul>
<li>none</li>
<li>whatsoever</li>
<li>(I don't like karaoke that much, but maybe I should get myself drunk one time and just try it :) )</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll not pass this one on, as I'm not a Londoner. Was fun though and got me thinking I should try some more cocktails ;)</p>
