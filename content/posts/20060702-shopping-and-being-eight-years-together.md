<p>Yesterday me and my girl went on a shopping spree. The damage is considerable [hm, somewhat more than &euro;0.5K for a total of five pairs of shoes and a lot of nice summer clothing for us both :P], but it was big fun! Our dinner was free, as we had a birthday party where we got something to eat too.</p>

<p>The shopping spree was sort of a prelude to today, the second of July 2006, on which me and my girlfriend are together for eight (sic!) years, and are engaged for a half [not that "being married in another half year" kind, just a formalised version of our togetherness :)]. Odd thing is, I still love her ;)</p>
