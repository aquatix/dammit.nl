<p>A project I've been doing on and off for the last few months is finally nearing completion as I just uploaded a neatly working version of it. Only some very minor things need fixing and I can finally look forward to doing my next big project -- my bachelor project -- besides the default hobby ones. Like, that feedreader that I need to make userfriendly and public. Ah, and from which I need to release the code, among that of some other of my projects.</p>
