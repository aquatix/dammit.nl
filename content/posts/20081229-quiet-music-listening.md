<p>When playing a newly-bought audio cd (bought directly from the artist, <a href="http://www.jennifergrassman.com/">Jennifer Grassman</a> - <a href="http://zenfilm.deviantart.com/art/Jennifer-Grassman-Pretty-Girls-106628281">movieclip of one of her beautiful songs</a>), I was annoyed at the amount of noise my DVD-drive made. Turned out the solution was easy:</p>

<pre>eject -x N /dev/cdrom</pre>

<p>where N should be replaced with a speed number, like 2 or 4. I entered 4 while playing and it spun down nicely, while continuing playing just fine. Serenity :)</p>
