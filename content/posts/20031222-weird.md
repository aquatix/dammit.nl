<p>Weird day today. First, the sun suddenly started shining. Then I found out I most likely threw away the letter with the receipt for getting my <acronym title="Openbaar Vervoer">OV</acronym> card [card needed to travel with the train, metro etc for "free"]. Think I was a little to rigorous while cleaning up my post a little while ago... After 2 hours of swearing at myself I found out I only needed the cardnumber, which you can find online on the site of the <a href="http://www.ib-groep.nl">IB-groep</a> when checking the page where you can find the date and post office to get your card. <i>sic</i>... Well, headed out for the hairdresser, waited for half an hour or longer and got a lot nicer look. Positive point of this day :) [not only for myself ;)]. Then got 4 [four] passport photo's for 7 [seven!] euro. Well, I guess the photographer has enough mouths to feed... Anyway, after another half an hour of waiting at the post office I finally get that darn card. Only to find myself in a miniature blizzard outside. Ah well, at least does my computer generate enough heat to make my room comfortable.</p>
<p>And while I'm at the subject of how lousy I'm surviving this day: I found out I broke my counter of the <a href="/cards/xmas2003.php">Christmas 2003 wishcard</a>. I hope I didn't brake everything I laid my hands on the last few weeks...</p>
