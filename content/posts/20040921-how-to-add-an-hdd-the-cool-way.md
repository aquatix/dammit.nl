<p>Added a 120GiB hdd drive to my workstation Saturday. I had it lying around for a while, and when I came to build it into my trusty AMD Duron 750MHz workstation, I figured it wasn't going to fit. Well, not in the drive bracket that is. There are already 2 hdd's in there, besides the archaic fdd drive, and as there's only room for those three, I had a problem. Well, I fixed it. Just check <a href="/images/screenies/various/serenity/p9182860.jpg">this picture</a> :) While I'm at it, check <a href="/images/screenies/various/serenity/p9192862.jpg">the drive setup</a> [drive is at the second controller; ATA100 promise controller - there's room for 8 drives in this little old beast!] and <a href="/images/screenies/various/serenity/p9202863.jpg">my messy desktop</a>. Real life desktop. My linux desktop is empty, because I hate having dozens of icons on it. Besides, <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">xfce4</a> doesn't even support them :)</p>
<p>Yay, now I finally have a bigass GNU/Linux install [linux only even] to mess around with!</p>
