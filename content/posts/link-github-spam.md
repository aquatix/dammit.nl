> Spam is nothing new, spam on GitHub is also not particularly new. Any site that accepts user-generated content will need to figure out how to prevent people from submitting spam, whether that is for scams, malicious software, or X-rated material. I have been getting tagged in Crypto related for the past 6 months or so. In the past 24 hours I have been tagged in two of them.

You would think some work and thought has been put into this for a while, but:

> How the actual fuck does GitHub NOT have a report button on a piece of user generated content. Do you know the process of reporting this? Copy Link -> Go to user’s profile page -> Click Block & Report -> Click Report Abuse button -> *New page* Click “I want to report harmful… cryptocurrency abuse” -> Click “I want to report suspicious cryptocurrency or mining content.” button -> FINALLY paste the link you copied 10 years ago into the form box and give your justification on why this user did a bad thing and hope that the link still works/content is still up by the time they get around to looking at it…

It's a good read, and makes you think what Microsoft (which is not a small company) has been doing all this time.

[Theo made a cool video about this article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEZ3WEdNS-c) with some of his personal thoughts and experiences as well (with his experience from working at Twitch, including the UX about making reporting spam as frictionless as possible).
