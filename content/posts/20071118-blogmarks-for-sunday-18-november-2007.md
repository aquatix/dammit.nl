<h3><a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/11/11/131255">Tracking People Using Bluetooth</a></h3>

<h3><a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20071109070012244">Putting the OpenDocument Foundation to Bed (without its supper)</a></h3>
<p>More information on the OpenDocument Foundation [not to confuse with the platform behind the OpenDocument Format] and W3C's <acronym title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_Document_Format">CDF</acronym>, which isn't meant to be an office document.</p>

<blockquote><p>So we were in a meeting when these articles about the Foundation and CDF started to appear, and we were really puzzled.  CDF isn't anything like ODF at all â€“ it's an "interoperability agreement," mainly focused on two other specifications - XHTML and SVG.  You'd need to use another W3C specification, called Web Interactive Compound Document (WICD, pronounced "wicked"), for exporting, and even then you could only view, and not edit the output.</p>

<p>The one thing I'd really want your readers to know is that CDF (even together with WICD) was not created to be, and isn't suitable for use, as an office format.</p></blockquote>
