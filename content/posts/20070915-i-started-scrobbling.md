<p>I've had a <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> account for quite a while now, and I've discovered quite some artists through that wonderful service. Recently, I installed <a href="http://www.frob.nl/scribble.html">mpdscribble</a>, an <a href="http://www.last.fm/help/">audio scrobbler</a> plugin for <a href="http://www.musicpd.org/"><acronym title="Music Player Daemon">mpd</acronym></a>. You can see what music I'm listening too at <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/aquatix/">my account page at Last.fm</a>.</p>
