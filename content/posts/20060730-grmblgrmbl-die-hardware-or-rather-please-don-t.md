<p>The fan of my server/mediabox/goddamnimportantfilesholder stopped spinning without my knowing and, it being the sole fan in the system as it's a small form factor machine with neat heatpipe and such, the whole machine turned into a lightbulb wannabe. Newsflash: that's not good for your parts [hdd!], stupid!</p>

<p>Anyway, after a considerable amount of wriggling, I got the fan connector loose of the motherboard, and reconnected it to another outlet thingee, as <a href="http://www.happyassassin.net/2005/11/20/i-hate-hardware/">someone on the internet discovered may work</a>. It did, thankfully, but I just wasted two hours sweating...</p>

<p>I second his notion: I hate hardware. It should freaking keep working.</p>
