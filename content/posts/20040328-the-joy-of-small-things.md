<p>Life ain't that bad you know. There are plenty of small and less small things in my life that are good. Like playing Soul Calibur 2 and Street Fighter with my friends after a disastrous exam week. Coming home from that and hug my girlfriend who's already waiting for me. Chatting with my family, taste of wine. Going home late.</p>
<p>Getting up early the next day [not that good ;)], having quite a good time at work, kicking some ass of colleagues who happen to be good friends too with Quake 3 Arena, coming home in an empty house [that's sometimes good too; I like to be on myself sometimes and this was good timing :)], eating some selfmade food, and then settle with laptop in lap in my easy chair, ready for a night of wegsurfing, reading and latenight chatting. Drinking the rest of the wine while doing that. Seeing your computerclock jump from 1:59AM to 3AM due to Daylight Saving Time and going to bed even later.</p>
<p>Waking up was a little harder :) But then there's coffee. And a small pleasure of seeing my old trusty grayscale <a href="/images/screenies/various/p3282363_small.jpg">Sony Clie PEG300S</a> get 23 hours of working time out of its small battery, in contrast to, for example, the uber leet <a href="http://www.palmone.com/us/products/handhelds/tungsten-t3/">Tungsten T3</a> with it's marvelous color screen, fast processor and 3 hours of working time on a charge. The joy of typing this entry on my own computer, listening U.N.K.L.E.</p>
<p>I guess counting the good things in your life can be quite refreshing and be good for your own mood, so there.</p>
