Summary: Software and things I use, and why

What I use for things and stuff.


## What Software Do I Use?

Quite a lot actually. Let's see...


### The Operating System

Linux, mostly the Ubuntu distribution. Yes, that sounds very boring, and that's mostly because it is, but It Just Works(tm) and I like tinkering with my own software better these days. (I [do customise it a bit though]({filename}../posts/prettifying_gnome.md)).

### Editors

- [vim]({tag}vim)
- JetBrains PyCharm (with vim bindings and Material Darker theme)
- Obsidian for notetaking and building out my [second brain]({tag}secondbrain)

### The Browser

Firefox.


### Other Software

A lot of terminal use.

- syncthing: synchronisation of files not under version control
- git: version control of notes, source code, correspondence, presentations and more
- paperless: archive and find back all your invoices, important documents and manuals
- navidrome: music server
- plex: media server
- (soon) Immich: photo collection software


### Mobile

Android phone, Pixel because the software is pretty fine and the camera's are up my alley. I love taking pictures.

- Obsidian
- Termux
- FairEmail for email
- FluffyChat and Element-X for Matrix chat
- weechat-android for IRC, makes connection to weechat on one of my servers
- TickTick for todo
- Symfonium and PlexAmp for music through Navidrome and Plex respectively
- Poweramp for music stored locally on my phone (works great with high-quality audio dongles like those from Hidisz)
- CoMaps for detailed maps derived from OpenStreetmap, for when I'm hiking or biking.


## Photography

- Trusty ol' Canon 70D digital SLR
- Canon 15-55mm f2.8 lense
- Sigma (Bigma) 150-500mm telelense


## And what Hardware?

### Desktop

### Laptops


## What would be your dream setup?

Linux-based mobile computing. [I'm actually prototyping a bit already](https://shuttereye.org/home/tech/zyberdeck/).
