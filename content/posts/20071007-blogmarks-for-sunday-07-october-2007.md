<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.brighthand.com/default.asp?newsID=13376">Third-Generation Nokia Internet Tablet Getting Close?</a></h3>
<p>Is this the successor to Nokia's N800? /me likes :)</p>
<h3><a href="http://brok3n.org/archivesextreme/2007/09/how_i_would_cha.html">How I would change Adium</a></h3>
<p>Musings about an alternative interface for the instant messaging program Adium. Myself, I'd like to see a tighter integration of a decent address book, email, IM and possible video/voice chat. At least the first three I would like to see integrated. A buddy list is just tedious; I want normal contact persons, with address info, email address[es], telephone numbers and IM accounts all in one. Makes sense, right? Evolution does some first steps, and the Evolution plugin for Pidgin is OK-ish too, but I'd like to see it integrated. And Evolution needs some tender loving care... Whole lots of it.</p>
<h3><a href="http://3voor12.vpro.nl/artikelen/artikel/36887169">[Dutch] Nieuw album Radiohead verschijnt zomaar over tien dagen!</a></h3>
<p>Radiohead's album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Rainbows">In Rainbows</a> will be for download from their website from the 10th of October for... whatever you want to give for it :) They will release a luxurious CD box at December, 3. Really nice action, with which they surprised the record labels, party because they don't use one for this album at all :)</p>

<h3><a href="http://jezebel.com/gossip/bonus-clip/is-elizabeth-taylor-going-to-marry-her-gay-boyfriend-305199.php">Bonus Clip: Is Elizabeth Taylor Going To Marry Her Gay Boyfriend?</a></h3>
<p>Normally I don't really care about Hollywood, but good ol' Elizabeth Taylor is hilarious in this snippet where she's asked whether she's going to marry that guy. The best part is the last three seconds. I'm still chuckling ;)</p>

<p>Also, check out <a href="http://jezebel.com/gossip/bonus-clip/omg-theres-more-elizabeth-taylor-red-carpet-footage-305225.php">the 'extended version'</a>.</p>

<p>Whoa, and I thought they should be able to run to catch the bad guys? Case of "pretty blue in the streets"?</p>
