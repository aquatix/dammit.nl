<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk">TestDisk - FS recovery</a></h3>
<p>The fucking shit. Yep, I used that word because this tool is so awesome that it can recover a doomed microsd card with a rather thoroughly broken FAT32 table. It even found 12GB of data on my 8GB card :) (It finds deleted and overwritten files too, but that's fine as I know which ones that are). I got all my important files back!</p>
