<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.marco.org/143265621">Serious doubts (on Apple Appstore)</a></h3>
<p>Some developer getting more and more fed up with Apple's (changing) policies, delays and lack of communication.</p>

<blockquote><p>Apple thinks reviews can take 8-30 days and web-capable apps need nudity warnings and the management interface can be buggy as shit and they don't need us to be able to reach them and nobody really needs to take any of this very seriously.</p>

<p>Because it's working for them. They're making a killing taking their 30% commission on the 1.5 billion copies of $0.99 top-25 games that they've sold. Who cares if the App Store discourages good developers from putting serious effort into it? Apple doesn't need to care. And, clearly, they don't.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some people (well, lots it seems) just don't get that concept</p>

<p>Some good points made there</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2009/birulki-18-en.shtml">Spillikinks #12 or what's wrong with Sony Ericsson</a></h3>
<p>Interesting story on why Sony Ericsson is not faring well. Their loss of identity (copying Nokia now) and other mediocre choices don't help them.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.oddee.com/item_96755.aspx">13 Most Unfortunate Personal Names for their Jobs</a></h3>
<p>I notice them on the news too now and then</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.hid.im/">hid.im - turn a .torrent into a .png</a></h3>
<p>A Hidim turns a torrent into a regular PNG image. That's quite nifty! PNGs will not turn up in a regular .torrent search, so helps staying under the radar. Of course, this is not necessary for your regular torrents of the latest Ubuntu release or Blender movie.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/johnny_lee_demos_wii_remote_hacks.html">Johnny Lee demos Wii Remote hacks [Video on TED.com]</a></h3>
<p>Awesomeness for the price of a Wiimote, a $5 IR pen or some small $10 head-mounted device. Great stuff.</p>
