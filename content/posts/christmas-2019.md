While I'm taking some down time from work - which is rather a bunch on my mind lately, which is both a good and less good thing - I will be spending a lot of time with my loved ones. My intention is to almost not touch computers in the upcoming few days. Let's see how that goes ;)

In the meanwhile, I will leave you with this little light, hand crafted by my oldest. Have some good time folks, whether it's Christmas or some other day.
