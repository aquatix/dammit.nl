<p>I just voted. I voted a left-wing party because, well, maybe they suck a little less in governing our country than the half-baked right-ish government we got after that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1971423.stm">Pim Fortuyn adventure</a>. But maybe they do better in the opposition like they are used to. Who knows? I wonder whether we'll find out, or whether that Wouter Bos figure is going to be our next minister-president. *Shiver*</p>

<p>On the less dark side I also enjoyed the second cold, sunny day in row. I like cold, sunny days. Especially after being thoroughly wetted by an icy, drizzly rain this dark Monday. Oh well, before that, we had some quite decent days, one of which I spend an hour on shooting some outdoor pictures with my digicam, themed "Castles", which I'll put online later.</p>

<p>Talking about rain: <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=481">I posted earlier on about the spam I was receiving, averaging 32.7 messages a day</a>. Well, I've been keeping a track on the spam I receive daily, and it's between 55 and 70 messages a day on my various accounts on my single domain. I've already passed the 11 thousand mark, as you can guess [I'm over the 11111 ones even :P], making the average a sad 34.15 messages/day for this year. Thank goodness for <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a>. Hm, reminds me to put a HOWTO online for running SpamAssassin under Debian with Exim4, an Exim rules file in your .forward and Dovecot.</p>

<p>Also, the trip to the voting office was done on my decent bicycle [I also have a bike which I use daily to trip to and fro the railway station], which my dad kindly repaired after it was thoroughly messed up by some morons on our city carnival. I wonder what's the fun in throwing other people's bikes around, stamping on them etc while giggling stupidly. Both my dad and I where amazed he was actually able to repair most of the damage himself [by tuning the spokes of the wheels quite a bit and bending the wheel casing]. Only need to go to the repair shop to get the shifting gear tweaked a bit.</p>

<p>Now I'll go back to reading journals for my paper and slides about <acronym title="Message Passing Interface">MPI</acronym> in C to refresh my parallel programming knowledge, which I - of course - have to bring into practice immediately. And I'm still waiting for a return mail from my study mentor about a paper and some other, quite important questions. *sigh*</p>
