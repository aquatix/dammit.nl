In my lunch break, I tinkered a bit with the [code generating this weblog](https://github.com/aquatix/dammit.nl), fixing some [theming](https://github.com/aquatix/voidy-bootstrap) bugs, adding metadata to some old posts and updated the [About page]({filename}../pages/about.md) a bit. There's also finally a [page overviewing all the tags](https://dammit.nl/tags.html) and the [categories page](https://dammit.nl/categories.html) also got some updates; both now also have feeds and link to them. The tags list just shows me that I really should go back to my old content and categorise a bit, but who has the time :)

In the meanwhile it's nicely sunny *and* foggy outside, apart from being quite cold, which is really one of my favourite types of weather all around. I think I'll go out for a short stroll and then finish my work for today.
