<p>Today I've been thinkering around with the code and layout of this weblog, and eliminated some elements that cause the content to jump around quite a bit. The text should look a lot better aligned this way, easier on the eye and such. Now to actually get text in here ;) Ah, the weekly blogmark postings have been given a slightly less dark font, so you can skip them more easily if you like (I hope). I also thinkered around quite a bit with the admin back-end, so hopefully that will induce me to write more.</p>

<p>In the same updates, I've added a minor anti-spammer challenge to commenting and enabled commenting globally again. The extra text is rather obvious, so should harm no real persons. If it harms spammers, rejoice. Now it's time to do a version control check-in and get some sleep. nn!</p>
