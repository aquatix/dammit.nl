<p>I just came along <a href="http://boingboing.net/2004_01_01_archive.html#107379846683537418">an old Boingboing posting</a> about the authors daughter being on the <acronym title="Computer Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening"><a href="http://www.eff.org/Privacy/cappsii/">CAPPS</a></acronym> list as a security risk. Just how stupid/scary can a Department of Homeland Security "war" become?</p>
