<p>In short: computing is boring, mostly because of no innovation [strangled by the OS'es available; specifically our dear windows]. Interesting interview</p>

<p>I'm not using Series 60 myself [I have a Sony Ericsson UIQ3 Symbian phone, on which I use <a href="http://coredump.fi/putty">PuTTY for UIQ3</a>], but Tam used my server to show off PuTTY on the S60 platform. Always fun :)</p>
<h3><a href="http://dannf.org/docs/debian-on-hannibal.html">Installing Debian 4.0 ('etch') and MythTV</a></h3>
<p>For future reference, when my media box is in the vicinity of my tv again... [and I have time for thinkering on the broken MythTV install]</p>
<h3><a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2007/jun/html-purifier">HTML Purifier</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>HTML Purifier is a standards-compliant HTML filter library written in PHP. HTML Purifier will not only remove all malicious code (better known as XSS) with a thoroughly audited, secure yet permissive whitelist, it will also make sure your documents are standards compliant, something only achievable with a comprehensive knowledge of W3C's specifications.</p></blockquote>
