<p>Argh, how I hate the <acronym title="Nederlandse Spoorwegen">NS</acronym> [Dutch Railways]...</p>
<p>I was up early to catch the train of 8:28AM on the other side of the station [for your information: that's a fair amount of sleepwalking]. So I bought my ticket, wandered over to the platform: empty indicator. So I checked my PalmWijzer [Palm program with the schedule in it], and found out the darn train isn't scheduled on Saturdays. Well, whatever. That leaves me waiting for the train of 8:44AM. In the freaking wind and fog, because the welcomingly lighted and heated waiting room is locked... So far for the service of the NS.</p>
<p>It doesn't help either when you arrive at Amsterdam Sloterdijk and have to wait another 15 minutes in the largest wind tunnel I've seen sofar: the Metro station [also FYI: that's the highest place of the whole complex, e.g. above the actual railway station]. Ah well, I guess I shouldn't complain because at least I wasn't stuck in a traffic jam.</p>
