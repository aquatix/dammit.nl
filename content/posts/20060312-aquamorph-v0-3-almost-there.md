<p>I know I've said it before, but the new version of <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/page/linux/aquamorph/">my livecd</a> is almost done. I'm now playing with the package configuration to keep the size down a bit; it turned out to be an .iso of about 420MiB, which I thought was a tad large. I left out some packages and fonts and it's smaller already. Also, I'm thinking about keeping out the Sun Java environment. Anybody has thoughts about that? It saves quite a lot of space :)</p>

<p>OK, when I don't put Java in there, but do include de audio/video codecs and some fonts, I have an .iso of 339MiB. That's a lot better. So, complaints about keeping Java out?</p>
