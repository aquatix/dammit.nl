<p>Interesting links of this week:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.idont.com/">iDon't [do iPod]</a></h3>
<p>Ah, <a href="http://www.sandisk.com/">more</a> <a href="http://www.anythingbutipod.com/archives/2005/01/about-anything-but-ipod.php">people</a> who know iPods aren't the only well-build music players [and not even the best out there].</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/19/pasemi_apple/">Apple shunned superstar chip start-up for Intel</a></h3>
<p>Hm, odd move; a fast, low power PPC chip [2GHz :)] would've been a more interesting heart than the PentiumM from Intel. At least I would still have thought about maybe buying an iBook</p>
