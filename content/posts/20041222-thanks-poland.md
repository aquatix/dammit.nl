<p>Thanks to Poland the proposal to allow <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/">software patents</a> <a href="http://www.tweakers.net/nieuws/35495">has been postponed</a> [Dutch link]. Our Dutch minister Brinkhorst and State Secretary Karien van Gennip where <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/log/04/cons1217a/index.en.html">trying to sneak in</a> a so-called A-item proposal on the Agriculture and Fishery conference to push the motion through the system. However, it seems they have deceived our Parliament [from which a lot of members are against software patents, thankfully], so they where halted. Thanks to Germany and Poland, from which several politicians protested and some computer scientists made their point, software patents haven't been shoved down our throats. If you are greatful too, <a href="http://thankpoland.info/">thank Poland here</a>.</p>
